[Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) gives you the full capability of your favourite IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code, Jupyter, or JetBrains and extension, to your web browser, and with it you can develop your applications without needing any dependant service or tool installed or configured locally, giving developers a standard way of working on applications and scripts.

Github Codespaces does this, by leveraging the power of the Cloud and GitHub, to run containers, that you can personalize to run your IDE, extensions, and any dependencies that you may need, whether you are a developer needing python, apache, react or a devops engineer requiring Bicep and Terraform support, Codespaces is an ideal enabler for our toolkit, in fact this article was written in a Github Codespace, using Visual Studio Code and Markdown extensions.
