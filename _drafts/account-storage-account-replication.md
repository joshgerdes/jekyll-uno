Not only can you change [your current Azure Storage account replication type](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/redundancy-migration?tabs=portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#perform-a-conversion "Change how a storage account is replicated") from LRS _(Locally-Redundant Storage)_ to ZRS _(Zone-Redundant Storage)_ or GRS by using a self-initiated request, but you can also replicate your files from 1 storage account to another.
