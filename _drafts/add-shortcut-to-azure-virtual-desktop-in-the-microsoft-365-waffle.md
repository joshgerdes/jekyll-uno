If you are like me, use the application launchers in the Microsoft 365 waffle daily, if not hourly! Then having it as a place to access all your applications is a no-brainer! 

That includes access to Azure Virtual Desktop! Luckily Microsoft has given us the ability to add Custom App Launchers to the Application Launchers in the waffle!

> Create custom tiles that will appear in the All apps section of the ‎Office 365‎ app launcher for all of your users. Users can pin the custom tiles directly to their app launcher for quick access.
