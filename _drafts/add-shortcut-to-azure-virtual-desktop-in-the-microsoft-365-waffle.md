If you are like me, use the Microsoft 365 waffle daily, if not hourly! Then having it as a place to access all your applications is a no-brainer! 

That includes access to Azure Virtual Desktop! Luckily Microsoft has given us the ability to add custom URLs to the Application Launchers in the waffle.

1. Open the [**Microsoft 365 Admin Panel**](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/homepage "M365 Admin")
2. Expand **Settings**
3. Click on **Org Settings**
4.
