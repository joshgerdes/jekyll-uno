I have a background in dotnet for server side coding but I wanted to get to know some other languages. I thought it might be fun to create a basic API in a bunch of languages and compare what the experience is like in each.

## The API structure
In order to compare the different languages we will build an API with the following:

 -

## dotnet

## nodejs

## go
