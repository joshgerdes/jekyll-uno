Building a cloud solution on Azure can be an exciting yet daunting task.

The key to a successful implementation is carefully planning and considering solution requirements using the guidance of the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure") and [Well Architecture frameworks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework").

But knowing what questions to ask and data to capture to give you the bigger picture - to not only consider the solution for the short term and long term, can be difficult. This is where the Azure architecture solution requirements checklist comes in.

Leaning on the great frameworks already in place to assist with the Cloud Adoption and Azure Well Architecture frameworks, the solution requirements checklist is intended to act as a way of asking and capturing the requirements of your solutions. It can be a great reminder to discover some of those requirements _(whether functional or non-functional)_ that you may have forgotten about!

I am using the [Azure Review Checklist](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists "Azure/review-checklists") - as a building block! I created a custom checklist intended to work with the review checklists - but aimed more at the discovery and requirements-gathering stage to assist with designing the proper outcomes for the business.
