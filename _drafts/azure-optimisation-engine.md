This post is part of [Azure Spring Clean](https://www.azurespringclean.com/ "Azure Spring Clean") 2022! 

This article, along with others of its kind _(Articles, Videos etc)_ cover Azure Management topics such as Azure Monitor, Azure Cost Management, Azure Policy, Azure Security Principles or Azure Foundations!

Today I will be covering the [Azure Optimization Engine](https://github.com/helderpinto/AzureOptimizationEngine "Azure Optimization Engine"). 

_Note: Although I had originally planned on having this as a video, due to delay in receiving appropriate equipment, I have fallen to an article, however, plan on making a video on this in the future, feel free to add/ask any questions in the comments section below and I will make sure to cover them in any future video._

### Overview

> The Azure Optimization Engine _(AOE)_ is an extensible solution designed to generate optimization recommendations for your Azure environment, like a fully customizable Azure Advisor. 
>
> The first custom recommendations use-case covered by this tool was augmenting Azure Advisor Cost recommendations, particularly Virtual Machine right-sizing, with a fit score based on VM metrics and properties.

The [Azure Optimization Engine]() canâ€¦

* Enable new custom recommendation types
* Augment Azure Advisor recommendations with richer details that better drive action
* Add fit score to recommendations
* Add historical perspective to recommendations _(the older the recommendation, the higher the chances to remediate it)_
* Drive automated continuous optimization

Azure Optimization Engine combines multiple data sources to give you better data-driven decisions and recommendations, outside of that usually deployed by the inbuilt Azure Advisor, example use-cases and data sources can be seen below:

* Azure Resource Graph _(Virtual Machine and Managed Disks properties)_ 
* Azure Monitor Logs _(Virtual Machine performance metrics)_ 
* Azure Consumption _(consumption/billing usage details events)_ 
* Extracts data periodically to build a recommendations history 
* Joins and queries data in an analytics-optimized repository _(Log Analytics)_ 
* Virtual Machine performance metrics collected with Log Analytics agent 
* Can leverage existing customer set-up 
* Requires only a few metrics collected with a frequency >= 60 seconds

> Besides collecting **all Azure Advisor recommendations**, AOE includes other custom recommendations that you can tailor to your needs:
>
> * Cost
>   * Augmented Advisor Cost VM right-size recommendations, with fit score based on Virtual Machine guest OS metrics _(collected by Log Analytics agents)_ and Azure properties
>   * Underutilized VM Scale Sets
>   * Unattached disks
>   * Standard Load Balancers without backend pool
>   * Application Gateways without backend pool
>   * VMs deallocated since a long time ago (_forgotten VMs)_
>   * Orphaned Public IPs
> * High Availability
>   * Virtual Machine high availability _(availability zones count, availability set, managed disks, storage account distribution when using unmanaged disks)_
>   * VM Scale Set high availability _(availability zones count, managed disks)_
>   * Availability Sets structure _(fault/update domains count)_
> * Performance
>   * VM Scale Sets constrained by lack of compute resources
> * Security
>   * Service Principal credentials/certificates without expiration date
>   * NSG rules referring to empty or non-existing subnets
>   * NSG rules referring to orphan or removed NICs
>   * NSG rules referring to orphan or removed Public IPs
> * Operational Excellence
>   * Load Balancers without backend pool
>   * Service Principal credentials/certificates expired or about to expire
>   * Subscriptions close to the maximum limit of RBAC assignments
>   * Management Groups close to the maximum limit of RBAC assignments
>   * Subscriptions close to the maximum limit of resource groups
>   * Subnets with low free IP space
>   * Subnets with too much IP space wasted
>   * Empty subnets
>   * Orphaned NICs

A few hours after setting up the engine, you'll get a Power BI dashboard with all Azure optimization opportunities, coming from both Azure Advisor and from custom recommendations included in the engine. These recommendations are then updated every 7 days and you can contribute with your own custom ones if needed.
