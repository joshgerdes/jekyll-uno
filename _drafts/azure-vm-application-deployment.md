The Azure Compute Gallery _(superseded the Shared Image Gallery)_ offers more than just Azure Image management and replication, you can deploy Applications to your Virtual Machines. 

> An Azure Compute Gallery helps you build structure and organization around your Azure resources, like images and [applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-applications). An Azure Compute Gallery provides:
>
> * Global replication.
> * Versioning and grouping of resources for easier management.
> * Highly available resources with Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) accounts in regions that support Availability Zones. ZRS offers better resilience against zonal failures.
> * Premium storage support (Premium_LRS).
> * Sharing across subscriptions, and even between Active Directory (AD) tenants, using Azure RBAC.
> * Scaling your deployments with resource replicas in each region.
