Chaos engineering has been around for a while, Netflix runs their own famous [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) supposedly running 24/7 taking down their resources and pushing them to the limit on a continuous basis, it almost sounds counter-intuitive â€“ but itâ€™s not.

> Chaos engineering is a methodology that helps developers attain consistent reliability by hardening services against failures in production. Another way to think about chaos engineering is that it's about embracing the inherent chaos in complex systems and, through experimentation, growing confidence in your solution's ability to handle it.
>
> A common way to introduce chaos is to deliberately inject faults that cause system components to fail. The goal is to observe, monitor, respond to, and improve your system's reliability under adverse circumstances. For example, taking dependencies offline (stopping API apps, shutting down VMs, etc.), restricting access (enabling firewall rules, changing connection strings, etc.), or forcing failover (database level, Front Door, etc.), is a good way to validate that the application is able to handle faults gracefully.

Introducing controlled chaos by tools such as Chaos Monkey and now â€“ [Azure Chaos Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/chaos-studio/), allows you to put pressure and in some cases, take down your services to teach you how your services will react under strain and identity areas of improvement such as resiliency and scalability to improve your systems.

Azure Chaos Studio _(currently in Preview and only supported in a number of_ [_regions_](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=chaos-studio) _currently)_ is an enabler for â€˜controlled Chaosâ€™ in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. Using that same tool that Microsoft uses to test and improve their services â€“ you can as well!

Chaos Studio works by creating Experiments _(i.e., Faults/Capabilities)_ that run against Targets _(your resources whether they are agent or service-based)_.

There are 2 types of methods you can use to target your resources:

* Service-direct
* Agent-based

Service-direct is tied into the Azure fabric and puts pressure on your resources from outside them _(i.e., supported on most resources that donâ€™t need agent-based, PaaS resources, such as Network Security Groups)_ A service-direct capability may be to add or remove a security rule from your network security group for faulty finding.

Agent-based relies on an agent installed, these are targeted at resources such as Virtual Machine and Virtual Machine scale sets, Agent-based targets use a user-assigned managed identity to manage an agent on your virtual machines and wreak havoc by running capabilities such as stopping services and putting memory and disk pressure on your workloads.

Just a word of warning, before you proceed to allow Chaos to reign in your environment, make sure it is done out of hours or better yet â€“ against development or test resources, also make sure that any resources that support autoscaling is disabled â€“ or you might suddenly find 10 more instances of that resource you were running _(unless of course youâ€™re testing that autoscaling is actually working)_! ðŸ˜Š

In my test setup, I have the following already pre-created that I will be running my experiments against:

* Virtual Machine Scale set _(running Windows with 2 instances)_
* Single Virtual Machine (running WIndows) to test shutdown against
