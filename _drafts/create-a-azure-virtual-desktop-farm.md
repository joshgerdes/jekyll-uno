## Overview

Previously known as Windows Virtual Desktop, [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/overview "What is Azure Virtual Desktop?") is the successor of Microsoft Remote Desktop, although compatible with Server OS (Operating System), it is the first to support Windows 10 _(and soon Windows 11)_ multisession, reducing application compatibility issues and giving consistent user experience.

In this guide, I am going to run you through creating Azure Virtual Desktop from scratch, along with some prerequisites that will help you manage AVD after you create it.

Before I begin, I recommend reading the Azure Virtual Desktop Azure product page "[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/ " Azure Virtual Desktop -   Enable a secure remote desktop experience from virtually anywhere.")" to get an understanding of the pricing model, features and additional resources that could help you in your journey.

Before we begin, when selecting a region for your Session Hosts (Virtual Machines), I recommend you have a look at the: [Azure Virtual Desktop Experience Estimator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/assessment/ " Azure Virtual Desktop Experience Estimator") to help valid the proper region for your Session Hosts and the round trip time _(I am in New Zealand, so my recommended region is: Australia East, which is what I will be using for this guide)_.

_If you don't already have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can sign up for a Free subscription "_[_here_](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ "Create your Azure free account today")_"._

Assuming you already have an Azure subscription and the appropriate access to create resources in that subscription, gets begin!

## Create Azure Active Directory Domain Services

1. Log in to the Azure Portal
2. Click on Create a resource
3. Search for: Azure AD Domain Services

_Note: You can change the Publisher Type to Microsoft, so it doesn't display any other marketplace offerings._

4. Click Create
5. If you already have a Resource Group, select it - in this Demo, we are going to create one: aad_prod
6. Type in the DNS domain name - this is the FQDN of your domain, in my demo, I am going to choose: internal.luke.geek.nz.
7. Because I am in New Zealand, the closest region to me at the moment is Australia East, so thatâ€™s the region I am going to select, make sure you select the appropriate region for where your Azure Virtual Desktop workloads are.
8. Select the SKU and Resource Type, you can see the Pricing Calculator and the "Help Me choose.." links to verify your SKU and Forest type _(however in most cases, such as Azure Virtual Desktop, your Forest Type will be 'User')_.

 9. Click Next
10. Now we will set up the Networking, if you have an already existing Virtual Network then select it

    _Azure AD Domain Services uses a dedicated subnet within a virtual network to hold all of its resources. If using an existing network, ensure that the network configuration does not block the ports required for Azure AD Domain Services to run._ [_Learn more_](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/create-instance?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_AAD_DomainServices)
11. In my case, I am starting from scratch so will let it create a Virtual Network and its Subnet (/24), click Next

![](/uploads/adds_networking.png)

12. Azure AD Domain Services, will create a new Azure AD Group called: AAD DC Administrators - this group will be used for Administrator level permissions on the Azure AD Domain Services domain (it automatically adds the account you are using to create Azure AD Domain Services into this group).
13. You can configure Membership of this group now and configure who gets alerted if there are issues with Azure AD Domain Services.
14. When you are ready select Next

![](/uploads/adds_admin.png)

13. Depending on the amount of Azure Active Directory users you have in your organisation and whether they will need Azure AD Domain Services, you can choose to synchronise ALL Azure AD Groups and Users, or specific groups of users (this can be changed later), because my Azure AD Organisation is fairly low, I am going to Sync everything, click Next.

_One thing to note here is the recommendation on the number of Objects (Users, Groups) that will get synced to Azure AD Domain Services, for the Standard SKU the suggested Object Count is 0 to 25,000 - for the Enterprise SKU, it is 25,000 to 100,000. Although there is no hard limit, if fit in the Enterprise space, it might be worth upgrading the SKU you are running for the additional backups and authentication._

14. We can now configure the Security Settings, the only setting I am going to change here is TLS 1.2 Only Mode to Enable

![](/uploads/adds_securitysettings.png)

15. Enter any applicable Tags and click Review & Create to validate your configuration
16. Review your configuration and if you are happy with it: Select Create.
17. Confirm that you are happy with the following and click Ok

![](/uploads/adds_youshouldknow.png)

Note: Azure AD Domain Services can take up to an hour to provision.

18. Once your Azure AD Domain Services has been configured we need to make some final configuration changes, one of them is to point the Virtual Network DNS to use the Azure AD Domain Services. Open your newly created Azure AD Domain Services.
19. Click on Overview and: Configuration issues for your managed domain were detected. Run configuration Diagnostics

![](/uploads/adds_configissues.png)

20. Click on Run
21. It should find a DNS record issue, click Fix to set the DNS settings of the Virtual Network to use the Azure AD Domain Services

Please be careful here, especially if you have already existing DNS settings, you might have to manually add it in.

## Create a Utility server to help Administer Azure Virtual Desktop

Now we need to create a Virtual Machine to help manage the AAD Domain and deploy Group Policies to help manage and configure the Azure Virtual Desktop farm.

1. Log in to the Azure Portal
2. Click on Create a resource
3. Search for: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter and select Create
4. If you already have a Resource Group, select it - in this Demo, we are going to create one: aad_infra
5. Specify a name for the Virtual Machine (I am going to use: UTILITY-P01)
6. Select a Region (use the same Region as the Azure AD Domain Services and Azure Virtual Desktop resources)
7. For the Image, you can select either Windows Server 2019 Datacenter -Gen 1 or Gen 2, in my case, I am going with Gen2.
8. For the size, I am a firm believer in selecting the lowest size possible, then scaling up when/where needed, I am going to go with a Standard_B2ms

![](/uploads/createvm1.png)

 9. Now we need to enter in the Administrator (local account) Username and Password
10. Select 'None' for Public inbound ports
11. If you have existing Windows Server licenses, then you can select Hybrid Use Benefit, if not select Next: Disks

![](/uploads/createvm2.png)

12. For the disks, I only need the OS disk, so don't need to add a Data Disk (although you could use this to store your Application install files etc), however, to reduce cost I am going to change the Disk type to Standard SSD (locally-redundant storage) and select Next: Networking

![](/uploads/createvmdisks.png)

13. For the Virtual Network, make sure you select the same Virtual Network that the Azure AD Domain Services has been installed to, I am going to select the: aadds-subnet created earlier for my Utility server.
14. Set 'None' for the Public IP and select Next: Management

![](/uploads/createvmnetworkinterface.png)

15. Feel free to leave this all as Default
16. Just be wary of the Auto-shutdown settings, which will automatically shut down the VM daily (I am going to keep mine selected as this is just a demo, and I only need the UTILITY server for initial configuration, it doesn't need to be running 24.7. 
17. If you have a Recovery Services Vault, now is a good time to add the Utility server to Backups so you don't forget it later, select Review & Create
18. Verify the configuration is correct and select Create

## Create Azure Bastion to connect to the Utility server

Once the VM has been created we now need to connect to it, securely so we are going to create a Bastion instance, which will allow us to connect to it without publishing the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) over the internet.

1. Log in to the Azure Portal
2. Click on Create a resource
3. Search for: Bastion

![](/uploads/bastionmarketplace.png)

 4. Click Create
 5. This is a Networking resource, so I am going to place it in the same Resource Group as my Virtual Network
 6. Type in a Name for the Bastion instance, I will call mine: Bastion
 7. Select the Region that matches the Virtual Network region
 8. Select the Virtual Network
 9. It now warns you about creating an: AzureBastionSubnet with a prefix of at least /27, so we need to create one, click on Manage Subnet Configuration
10. Click + Subnet
11. For the Name type in: AzureBastionSubnet
12. For the Subnet address range: 10.0.1.0/27

_If you get an error that indicates the address is overlapping with the aadds-subnet, it may be because the Address space is only a /24, click Cancel and click on Address Space in the Virtual Network and change the /24 to/16, to increase the address range._

13. Click Save to create the subnet

![](/uploads/az_subnet.png)

14. Up the Top, click Create a Bastion, to go back to the Bastion setup, your Subnet should be selected automatically.
15. You do need a Public IP for Bastion, so confirm the name is appropriate then click Review + Create

![](/uploads/bastionsetup.png)

16. Click on Create to create your Bastion instance!

Note: Bastion may take 10-20 minutes to provision.
