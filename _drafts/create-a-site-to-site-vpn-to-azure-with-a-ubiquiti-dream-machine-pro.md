The Ubiquiti [Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/udm-pro "Dream Machine Pro"), has a lot of functionality built-in, including IPsec Site-to-site VPN _(Virtual Private Network)_ support.

I recently, installed and configured a UDM-PRO at home, so now it's time to set up a site-to-vpn to my Microsoft Azure network.
