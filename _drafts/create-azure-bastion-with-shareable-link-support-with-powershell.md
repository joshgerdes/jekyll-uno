[Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "What is Azure Bastion?") is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal or via the native SSH or RDP client installed on your local computer.

#### Overview

> The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS.

Because of this, if you don't have line-of-sight access to your Virtual Machines (_via express route, Site-to-Site VPN etc.)_, Bastion becomes your jump box, allowing secure access to your virtual machines without needing a public IP.

There is a downside, though. To connect to a Virtual Machine secured by Bastion, you need access to the Azure Portal, or command line connectivity to Azure, to create the tunnel; this means that you may need to grant people elevated rights and access they may not need to connect.

As of November 2022[,]() Microsoft introduced shareable links into public preview, solving two key pain points:

* Administrators will no longer have to provide full access to their Azure accounts to one-time VM usersâ€”helping to maintain their privacy and security.
* Users without Azure subscriptions can seamlessly connect to VMs without exposing RDP/SSH ports to the public internet.

> The Bastion **Shareable Link** feature lets users connect to a target resource (virtual machine or virtual machine scale set) using Azure Bastion without accessing the Azure portal. 

At the time of this writing, there are some [scenarios ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/shareable-link?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#considerations "Create a shareable link for Bastion")where shareable links won't work - particularly across Network peering across subscriptions and regions.

Because the service is in Public Preview - native PowerShell cmdlet support, enabling and configuring this feature isn't available - but you can easily enable it via the [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/shareable-link?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#enable-shareable-link-feature "Enable Shareable Link feature").

To get around that, we will leverage the [Azure Rest API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Azure REST API reference") directly, using PowerShell to enable the Shareable Link feature and create and obtain a shareable link for a Virtual Machine.

#### Create Azure Bastion

I will assume there is already an Azure Virtual Network created; if not, you can follow the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Quickstart: Create a virtual network using the Azure portal") to get it up and running!

The PowerShell function we will run will require a few parameters to create the Azure Bastion resource and enable Shared Link functionality; these parameters are:
