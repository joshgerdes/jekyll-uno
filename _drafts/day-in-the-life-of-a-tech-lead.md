Being a 'Technical Lead' or 'Tech Lead' means different things to some people and organisations; based on definitions found online, a Technical Lead is:

> "A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases."

Although I agree with this, I would flesh out a bit more of architectural governance across it - it also doesn't need to be software development heavy; it can sit in the operational and delivery spaces as well _(waterfall or agile)_.

These thoughts are purely my own.

This is what a day in the life of a technical lead is to me:

#### Day in the Life of a Tech Lead:

* Work alongside: Technical Product Owners, Chapter Members, Architecture, Business stakeholders and Service Partners to develop/roadmap/architect and improve technology.
* Manage delivery and operational risks and dependencies, and remove impediments to the achievement of the team objectives
* Test and develop roadmaps for preview Cloud capabilities for immediate or future value
* Act as a Subject Matter Expert _(or Consultant)_ to assist in Design Decisions, Monitoring, Cost and Capacity Requirements
* Develop Governance processes for onboarding services into BAU, enabling Technology Infrastructure and Operations staff to use technology in a consistent and secure manner
* Work alongside Security and Developers to enable cross-team visibility and collaboration
* Champion improvements in People/Processes and ways of working
* Work alongside Chapter Members and Chapter Lead to develop Training/Skill programs for Technical areas
* Develop and promote an 'everything as code', 'everything is automated' mindset
* Problem/Incident Management _(i.e. Continous improvement)_

#### A Technical lead mindset may look like below:

* Automate what's trivial, boring, mundane, and belittling
* Build what you can't buy. Buy what you can't live without
* Make your work visible. Shift your value to performance.
* Work is never completed. Establish feedback loops.
* Target high impact problems.
* Log what's useful, monitor what matters, alert on what's actionable
* Empower others while making sure that everything is auditable, standardised.

The views above are my own, but shout out to [Teal Unicorn](https://tealunicorn.com/ "Teal Unicorn") for independent consulting on Ways of Working, Continuous improvements; I attended a few of their workshops on ways of working, consulting, and learning about this kind of thinking.

Overall, I have noticed that Information Technology roles are now blending disciplines that were once required. specific job roles _(ie Business Analyst, Service Delivery Manager, Developer, Architect),_ although pure technical roles still exist with Cloud technologies, different skillsets are required to get the most value out of technology stacks.
