Being a 'Technical Lead' or 'Tech Lead' means different things to some people and organisations, based on definitions found online a Technical Lead is:

> "A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases."

Although I do not disagree with this, I would flesh out a bit more of architectural governance across it - it also doesn't need to be software development heavy, it can sit in the operational and delivery spaces as well _(waterfall or agile)_.
