Have you ever wanted to export an icon from the Microsoft Azure Portal, but found yourself having to screenshot the icon at a low definition to include in your documentation or presentations?

Well - using the [Amazing Icon Downloader browser](https://github.com/mattl-msft/Amazing-Icon-Downloader "logo Amazing Icon Downloader") plugin, you can now export a single or all icons on a specific page in high definition as an SVG _(Scalable Vector Graphics)_ file.

The Amazing Icon Downloader plugin

* Easily view all icons on a page, works with:
  * portal.azure.com
  * endpoint.microsoft.com
* Search to filter down long lists of icons
* Rename and download any single icon
* Bulk download all icons as a .zip file
