[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) (_Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development, allowing versioning, source control and enablement of continuous Integration and deployment)_ has been around for years _(development and the first release began in 2005 by Linus Torvolds)_, and although primary driven and consumed by software developers – it is now a staple of everyday life for an IT professional of many disciplines _(ie Operations, Delivery),_ even if a git repository is used to store your PowerShell scripts _(hint – it should!)_.

Although tools such as Visual Studio Code, allows you to easily utilize git source control, and of course, you can use git directly from the command line, sometimes you simply want an easy way to leverage git through a point and click interface directly on your Desktop, there a lot of tools out there to give you easy access to git, but today I will concentrate on Github Desktop.

If you are looking at something a bit more powerful, then I suggest [Atlassian Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree "Atlassian Sourcetree").

Introducing Github Desktop... “_Focus on what matters instead of fighting with Git. Whether you're new to Git or a seasoned user, GitHub Desktop simplifies your development workflow.”_

Github Desktop gives you a clean, light and easy to use tool to work with git repositories, that is constantly [kept up to date](https://github.com/desktop/desktop "Github Desktop - Github") and improved upon

Although Github Desktop, is published by Github – this doesn’t mean you cannot use a git repository hosted by another provider, such as Azure DevOps.

This article assumes that you have a Git repository initialised already, you can create free repositories from [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min "Azure DevOps") or [Github](https://github.com/ "GitHub"), they are both owned by Microsoft, personally, I have moved from Azure DevOps to Github for my git repositories, but utilise AzureDevOps pipelines.

### Install Github Desktop

Installation of Github Desktop is pretty simple, but assuming you have rights to install the software:

1. In your web browser, navigate to [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) homepage and click on: **Download**
2. ![Github Desktop - Download](/uploads/githubdesktop-download.png "Github Desktop - Download")
3. You should have a file such as GitHubDesktopSetup-x64.exe, once it's downloaded _(should only take a few seconds, the file is about 109 MB at the time this was written)_ then run it to install.
4. ![Github Desktop - Installing](/uploads/githubdesktop-installing.png "Github Desktop - Installing")

Congratulations, you have now installed Github Desktop!

### Add your Azure DevOps repository

If you have an Azure DevOps git repository, then follow the steps below – if you have chosen to go: Github, then feel free to skip this section for the next.

 1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min "Azure DevOps")
 2. Navigate to the project you want to add to Github Desktop
 3. Click on Repos, Files
 4. ![Azure DevOps - Repo](/uploads/azuredevops-repos.png "Azure DevOps - Repo")
 5. In the address bar, you will see your URL, it should look like this: [https://dev.azure.com/%username%/_git/%projectname%](https://dev.azure.com/%username%/_git/%projectname% "https://dev.azure.com/%username%/_git/%projectname%")
 6. Copy the URL and open Github Desktop
 7. Click on File and Clone a repository
 8. Click on URL
 9. ![Github Desktop - Clone a Repository](/uploads/githubdesktop-clonearepo.png "Github Desktop - Clone a Repository")
10. Paste in the repository URL you copied earlier
11. Select the Local path of where you want the Git repository to be saved locally on your device
12. Now we need to generate git credentials to clone your repository, navigate back to Azure DevOps
13. ![Azure DevOps - Clone](/uploads/azuredevops-clonerepo.png "Azure DevOps - Clone")
14. Click on Generate Git Credentials
15. Azure DevOps will now generate the username and password that will be used by Github Desktop to authenticate with your git repository.
16. Navigate back to Github Desktop
17. Click Clone
18. Enter in the username and password that you received from the git credentials, generated by Azure DevOps.
19. Github Desktop should now clone your repository locally.

Congratulations, you have now set up an Azure DevOps git repository using Github Desktop.

### Add your Github repository

If you have an Azure DevOps git repository, then follow the steps above – otherwise, follow these steps to add your Github repository into Github Desktop.

1. Open Github Desktop
2. Click File
3. Click Clone repository….
4. ![Github Desktop - Clone repository](/uploads/githubdesktop-cloneareposnap.png "Github Desktop - Clone repository")
5. On the Github.com tab, enter your Github credentials
6. Select the Local path of where you want the Git repository to be saved locally on your device
7. Click Clone

Congratulations, you have now set up a Github git repository using Github Desktop.

### Using Github Desktop

Now that you have a git repository cloned locally, it's time to use it.

#### Initial Commit

Once you have a file created and saved into the folder of your git repository, ie a PowerShell script, you will want to commit it to the git repository.

1. Open Github Desktop
2. Click on: Current repository to make sure your repository is selected
3. ![Github Desktop - Initial Commit](/uploads/githubdesktop-initialhelloworld.png "Github Desktop - Initial Commit")
4. In my example, I have created a new file called: HelloWorld.ps1 in my PowerShell repository
5. What you can see in the screenshot below, is the various components that make up the Github Desktop, you can see the changed file (ie the new file), the contents of the file and what will be added, the commit title and the all-important commit description.
