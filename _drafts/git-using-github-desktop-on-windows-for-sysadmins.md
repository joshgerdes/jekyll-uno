[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) (_Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development, allowing versioning, source control and enablement of continuous Integration and deployment)_ has been around for years _(development and the first release began in 2005 by Linus Torvolds)_, and although primary driven and consumed by software developers – it is now a staple of everyday life for an IT professional of many disciplines _(ie Operations, Delivery),_ even if a git repository is used to store your PowerShell scripts _(hint – it should!)_.

Although tools such as Visual Studio Code, allows you to easily utilize git source control, and of course, you can use git directly from the command line, sometimes you simply want an easy way to leverage git through a point and click interface directly on your Desktop, there a lot of tools out there to give you easy access to git, but today I will concentrate on Github Desktop.

If you are looking at something a bit more powerful, then I suggest [Atlassian Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree).

Introducing Github Desktop... “_Focus on what matters instead of fighting with Git. Whether you're new to Git or a seasoned user, GitHub Desktop simplifies your development workflow.”_
