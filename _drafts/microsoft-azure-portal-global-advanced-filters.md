We've all been there! In the Azure portal, looking for a resource or subscription and cannot find it! Once permissions are ruled out, you are left with the Portal itself, and the filter.

You may see a checkbox or message like the below:

> Show only subscriptions selected in the [global subscriptions filter](https://portal.azure.com/#settings/directory "Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions")
>
> ![Show only subscriptions selected in the global subscriptions filter](/uploads/azureportal_globalfilter.png "Show only subscriptions selected in the global subscriptions filter")

This is because the Microsoft Azure portal has a default filter, which is very handy in hiding subscriptions and resources you don't want to see or use all the time.

The following Microsoft document '[Manage Azure portal settings and preferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/set-preferences?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Manage Azure portal settings and preferences")' is a great place to start, but let us take a look ourselves.
