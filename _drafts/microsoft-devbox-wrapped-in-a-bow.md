It's that time of year again! The time to be jolly and experience the Month of December, by looking at the [Festive Tech Calendar](https://festivetechcalendar.com/ "Festive Tech Calender")!

> This year the Festive Tech Calendar Team is **raising money** for the charity [@missingpeople](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/).
>
> We believe its important to support charities that do great work. Without fundraising Missing People wouldn’t be able to find vulnerable missing people and reunite families.
>
> #### If you would like to donate please visit our [Just Giving Page](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/festivetechcalendar2022).

Today, we are going to unwrap our present and take a peek inside the box - at Microsoft Dev Box!

#### Overview

[Microsoft Dev Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/dev-box/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#overview "Microsoft Dev Box") provides self-service access for developers to high-performance, cloud-based workstations preconfigured and ready-to-code for specific projects—all while maintaining security and corporate governance. With Microsoft Dev Box, organizations can:

* Maximize dev productivity with ready-to-code, self-service Dev Boxes.
* Centralize governance of workstations running anywhere to maintain greater security, compliance, and cost efficiency.
* Customize dev boxes with everything developers need for their current projects.

Microsoft Dev Box supports any developer IDE, SDK, or tool that runs on Windows. Developers can target any development workload that can be built from Windows including desktop, mobile, IoT, and web applications. Microsoft Dev Box even supports building cross-platform apps thanks to Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows Subsystem for Android. Remote access gives developers the flexibility to securely access dev boxes from any device, whether it’s Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, or a web browser.

Essentially, Microsoft Dev Box is a managed service that enables developers to create on-demand, high-performance, secure, ready-to-code, project-specific workstations in the cloud.

Microsoft Dev Box is available today as a [preview ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-microsoft-dev-box/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Public preview: Microsoft Dev Box")from the Azure Portal. During this period, organizations get the first 15 hours of the dev box 8vCPU and 32 GB Memory SKU for free every month, along with the first 365 hours of the dev box Storage SSD 512 GB SKU. 

Beyond that, organizations pay only for what they use with a consumption-based pricing model. With this model, organizations are charged on a per-hour basis depending on the number of Compute and Storage that are consumed.
