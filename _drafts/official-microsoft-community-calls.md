You don't have a be a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft MVP") to engage with Microsoft product teams, and help give feedback! One of the best ways that the Microsoft product teams engage with the community- is through Public Community Calls!

Here is a list of the community calls across [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Microsoft Azure") products.
