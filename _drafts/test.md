Today we are going to take a look at the [Microsoft Azure Elastic SAN](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/elastic-san/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). 

#### Introduction

> “Azure Elastic SAN is a unique cloud-native and fully managed storage area network (SAN) service. Combining SAN-like capabilities with the benefits of being a cloud-native service, Azure Elastic SAN offers a massively scalable, cost-effective, high-performance, and resilient storage solution. It can connect to a variety of Azure compute services, enabling you to seamlessly transition your SAN data estate to the cloud without having to refactor your application architectures.”

Azure Elastic SAN provides a storage solution that is highly scalable, cost-effective, high-performing, and resilient. It caters to various storage needs, whether you're migrating your on-premises SAN to the cloud or creating your application directly in the cloud.



A Storage Area Network (SAN) typically comprises one or more physical appliances equipped with multiple drive bays, which are used to create volumes – it is considered a high-performance and low-latency connectivity
storage solution.

The benefits of a SAN are:

* Grow storage footprint independent of Compute
* Low latency and high storage throughput
* Cost efficient with massive scale.
* Built for databases and IOPS-intensive
  applications.
* Supports large virtualization deployments.
