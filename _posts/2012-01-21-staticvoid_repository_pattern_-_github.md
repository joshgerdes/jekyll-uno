I've been wanting to have a play with GitHub for a while now given so many open source projects seem to be using it. So I finally gave it a go and pushed my Repository Pattern stuff to a public GitHub repository.

The source is very simple so feel free to take a look and fork it if you want to make some changes.
There's a few things I'm interested in implementing around the repository:

 - An automatically cached repository
 - A unit of work layer
 - Improvements to the in memory data source to automatically set backward references
 - A CQRS implementation which automatically pushes writes through a message bus

Anyway go and grab the source and have a play.
