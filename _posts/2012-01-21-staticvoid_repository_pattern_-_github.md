I've&nbsp;been wanting to have a play with GitHub for a while now given so many open source projects seem to be using it. So i finally gave it a go and pushed my Repository Pattern stuff to a public GitHub repository. <br />
<br />
The source is very simple so feel free to take a look and fork it if you want to make some changes.<br />
There's a few things I'm interested in implementing around the repository:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>An&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;cached repository</li>
<li>A unit of work layer</li>
<li>Improvements to the in memory&nbsp;data source&nbsp;to automatically set backward references</li>
<li>A CQRS implementation which automatically pushes writes through a message bus</li>
</ul><div>Anyway go and grab the source and have a play.</div><div><br />
