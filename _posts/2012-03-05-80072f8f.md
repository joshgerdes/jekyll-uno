Getting the annoying 80072F8F error? When all  you want to do is download & install the latest Windows Updates? Luckily for you the fix is simple. Make sure the Time & Date is correct.

  1. Click Start
  2. Click Control Panel
  3. Click Time & Date
  4. **Adjust Time & Date**, you can also set the computer to download the latest Time/Date from Microsoft servers.
  5. **Restart** & **run** Windows **Update**.

_Another issue is the Windows root certificate, which you need to update. If you have made sure both your time and date are correct, then try downloading:_
