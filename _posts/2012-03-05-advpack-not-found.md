Advpack.dll Not Found is only one version of the error messages that Advpack.dll can create – “&#8221;This application failed to start because advpack.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem” is another known error.

Although mainly occurring in the older versions of Windows I have seen this error occur from Windows XP through to Windows 7 and is mainly caused by installing the wrong .Net Framework for your computers architecture – for example attempting to install .Net Framework x86 on a 64 bit version of Windows.
