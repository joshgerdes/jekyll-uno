Having the problem where BearShare opens when you open a new Firefox tab even after removing BearShare? This is how I fixed it.

  1. Open My **Computer** (Double left click on Desktop icon, or go to Start, Computer)
  2. **Navigate** (using the left mouse button) to_ **C:Program Files**_
  3. Right click the **Bearshare** folder & **Delete**
