**Torrent Indexers**
  
Torrent indexers are sites that have a searchable directory of torrent files, but don’t host a (public) tracker of their own. Mininova has a tracker, but they only allow ‘featured’ torrents uploaded through their content distribution service. The most used torrent indexers are:

  * Mininova
  * IsoHunt
  * Torrentreactor
  * BTjunkie

**Torrent Meta-Seach Engines**
  
BitTorrent meta-search engines are yet another brand of torrent sites. They don’t have a tracker and don’t host any torrent files on their servers. Instead they search for and link to torrents hosted on third party sites.

  * Torrentz
  * Nowtorrents
  * Qtorrents
  * Torrent-Finder

**Private Trackers (open signup)**
  
Most of the larger private trackers require an invite to join, but there are always a few that allow new members. Below are four of these (open) private trackers and more can be found on Btracs.

  * RTN
  * BiteMyTorrent
  * BitShock
  * TorrentIt
  * Digital Abyss

**Standalone BitTorrent Trackers**
  
Torrent indexers and meta-search engines can be used to find torrents, but none of them will be of much use without a stable BitTorrent tracker. Standalone BitTorrent trackers are much needed, they handle the communication between downloaders but don’t index any torrents themselves.

  * OpenBitTorrent
  * PublicBitTorrent
  * The Hidden Tracker
  * Denis.Stalker

Google, has a _**filetype:torrent**_ search command that allows you to find torrent files scattered across the Internet. .
