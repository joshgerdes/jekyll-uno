The problem usually occurs when the Encoder strip a think plastic strip falls out of its guide inside the printer. Here is how to fix it:

  1.  **Lift scanner cover** and **remove the two plastic panels covering wires**. Mark down position of cables then remove them, and **remove the now-freed top scanner section entirely**
  2.  **Remove screws from top plastic shell** _(There&#8217;s two in the back and four in the front, there&#8217;s also two plastic tabs in the front that must be bent aside before you can remove the top shell.)_
  3. Gently **put the encoder strip** back in its **plastic guide**.
  4. **Restart Printer**
