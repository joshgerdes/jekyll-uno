**To Open Nero**

  1. Click **Start**
  2. Click **All Programs**
  3. Click **Nero**
  4. Click **Nero StartSmart**

**Burning a CD using Nero StartSmart**

  1. At the **top** of Nero make sure you have &#8220;**CD/DVD**&#8221; selected.
  2. To make an **Audio or Data CD select the relevant icon**.
  3. **Click Make Data / Make Audio CD**.
  4. Click **Add**
  5. **Select** the **files** you would like to burn to the **CD** and select **Add**.
  6. Select **Finished** when you have **finished** **adding** **the** **files** you want to burn.
  7. Click **Next**
  8. **Change the Disc Name** to something relevant.

_If you keep having problems burning the CD/DVDs you can lower the burning speed to improve an accurate burn at the same window as the Disc Name._

_If you have problems ejecting the CD/DVD drive after burning it might be faulty and you can try ejecting by going into My Computer, Right click the CD/DVD drive and select Eject._
