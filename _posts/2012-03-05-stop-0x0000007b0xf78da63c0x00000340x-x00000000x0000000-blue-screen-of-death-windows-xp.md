Trying to boot Windows XP and getting the STOP 0x0000007B BSOD?

This usually occurs when Windows is trying to repair/load from a SATA drive, without the appropriate SATA drivers. This is the way I fixed it, due to the fact that many BIOs are different they are generic instructions which should hopefully be easy to follow in your particular circumstance.

  1. Enter the Computer&#8217;s BIOs (Usually it is F1 or F2 at computer boot)
  2. Go into the HDD Section or an area indicating any Controller options (Using the Arrow Keys & the Enter button to navigate)
  3. **Change** the HDD **controller** from AHCI/SATA or Raid to **_ATA or IDE_**
  4. **Restart** the computer boot up or Windows install.
