This usually happens after deleting or renaming Dial-up accounts, especially when the email client is set to check your mail with a certain account.

  1. **Recreate** the **account** _(Make sure that you have all the details that you need, including your Incoming & Outgoing Mail settings, ISP Username & Password)_
  2. Create the mail account from scratch
  3. **Delete** the **old** mail **account**
