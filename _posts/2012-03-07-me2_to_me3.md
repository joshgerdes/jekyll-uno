Problems importing your Mass Effect 2 save game into Mass Effect 3, this is caused because Mass Effect 3 actually looks to the Mass Effect 2 folder.

  1. Click **Start**
  2. Click My Documents/**Documents**
  3. Go into the **Bioware** folder
  4. Right click, select **Create** **New**, **Folder**
  5. **Name** it &#8220;**Mass Effect 2**&#8220;
  6. **Go** into the newly **created** Mass Effect 2 **folder** and **make** a **new** **folder** called &#8220;**Save**&#8220;
  7. **Go** into the **Save** **Folder**
  8. Now **create** a **new** **folder** for your **character** **save** ieÂ Luke\_30\_Adept_070212
  9. **Go** **into** your new **folder**, and **paste** your **save** **game** from Mass Effect 2 into it.
 10. Now **run** **Mass** **Effect** **3**, **Go** to **New** **Game**, **Import** **ME2** **Character** & **choose** **Import** **Career**.
 11. Now you should be able to **play**!

_If the above doesn&#8217;t work. You need to reinstall Mass Effect 2. Copy your save game back to the Mass Effect 2 folder in My Documents/Bioware/Mass Effect 2/Save and load your save game back into Mass Effect 2. Then save your game again. Exit out of Mass Effect 2, load Mass Effect 3 and you should be able to import your character._
