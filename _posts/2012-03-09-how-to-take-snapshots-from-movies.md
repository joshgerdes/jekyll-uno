Ever wanted to capture that perfect scene from a movie or video clip? Heres how to do it.

**Using Windows Media Player**

  1. At the scene you would like to save, press Ctrl-I at the same time to save the snapshot.

**Using <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank">VideoLAN</a> (VLC Media Player)**

  1. Pause the scene that you would like to save, by pressing the Space Bar.
  2. Click Video
  3. Click Snapshot
  4. Your snapshot of the scene has now been saved, usually to My Pictures. However the location can be changed in VLC&#8217;s settings.
