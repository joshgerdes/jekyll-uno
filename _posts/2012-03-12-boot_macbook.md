_Want to boot from CD/DVD on your Macbook but don&#8217;t know how? The answer is simple!_

  1. **Hold** the &#8220;**Option**&#8221; key on the keyboard **duringÂ start**&#8211;**up**.
  2. **Using** the arrow keys, **select** the **CD**/**DVD** Drive at the **menu** and select **return**.

_Using this same method you can switch between Bootcamp and the OSX install._
