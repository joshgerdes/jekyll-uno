Want to restore a Gateway computer back to factory settings? This is how you access the eMachines recovery partition

  1. Turn **computer** **on**
  2. **Press Alt-F10** at same time
  3. The **recovery** process **will** **start**.

_Keep in mind, the recovery process will remove all your user data, including documents & pictures and restore the computer back to when you had first turned it on._
