_Here is how you edit the Bit Torrent upload speed in Opera 9._

  1. Open **Opera**
  2. In the **Address** **bar** **type**: **opera:config** _(This is a hidden settings panel for opera)_
  3. **Click** **Bit** **Torent**
  4. In the **Max** **Upload** **Rate** **field** **type** the maximum upload rate _(in kilobytes)_ you would like to go to.
  5. Click **Save**
  6. **Restart** Opera

_If you restart your broswer and realise that the torrents are no longer downloading. Check your download folder and reopen them again._
