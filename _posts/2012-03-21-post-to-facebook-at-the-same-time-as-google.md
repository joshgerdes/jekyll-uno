Ever wanted to post on Google+ and have it automatic post Facebook as well? This is how you can do it.

  1. Find your secret email ID by logging into the <a title="Facebook Mobile" href="http://m.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Mobile page _(Look for the email address at the bottom of the page)_
  2. Go to your <a title="Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/" target="_blank">Google+</a> profile and write something you would like to share.
  3. Add your secret email address along with whatever circles you want to share the post with and then hit share.

Your post should now be shared with your Facebook account as well.
