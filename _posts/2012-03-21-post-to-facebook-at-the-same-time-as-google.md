Ever wanted to post on Google+ and have it automatic post Facebook as well? This is how you can do it.

  1. Find your secret email ID by logging into the <a title="Facebook Mobile" href="http://m.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Mobile page _(Look for the email address at the bottom of the page)_
  2. Go to your <a title="Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/" target="_blank">Google+</a> profile and write something you would like to share.
  3. Add your secret email address along with whatever circles you want to share the post with and then hit share.

_Your post should now be shared with your Facebook account as well._
