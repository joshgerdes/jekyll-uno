Having problems opening Word? This usually occurs when the template that it uses to generate a new fresh page is corrupted. Follow the instructions below to fix:

  1. Open My Documents
  2. Up the top, select Tools
  3. Select Folder Options
  4. Select View
  5. **Enable** **Hidden** Files**/folders**
  6. Press Ok
  7. Close My Documents
  8. Click Start
  9. Click **Search**
 10. In the search field type: **normal.dot**
 11. **Delete** the **Normal.dot** file that appears in the search result.
 12. **Open Word**

The file might also be located in the folders below, and is also safe to delete.
