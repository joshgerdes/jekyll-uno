  1. First you need to **login** to Facebook
  2. Then go **into** the **group** you want to **delete** (Should be on the left hand Navigation bar)
  3. Click **See All** to view all members
  4. **Delete** all **members** from the group
  5. Then select **View Admins** & **remove** all other **Admins** and **remove** **yourself** **LAST**.
  6. **Facebook** **will** detect that the group has no members and **delete** the **group**
