If you find that your Laptop&#8217;s letters have started to type numbers, the fix for this is quite simple.

  1.  At the same time press **FN+Numlock**

_If that doesn&#8217;t work, try the following:_

  1.  At the same time press **Shift+Numlock**

That&#8217;s it, it should be now typing letters.
