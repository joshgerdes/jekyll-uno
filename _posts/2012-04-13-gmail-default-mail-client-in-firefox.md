If you have Gmail and use the Firefox web browser, having gmail as your default email client for typing out emails will be handy and save alot of time. Here is how you do it.

  1. Open Firefox
  2. Left click Tools
  3. Left click Options
  4. Left Click Applications
  5. Go down the list until you find &#8220;mailto&#8221;
  6. In the drop down menu to the right of &#8220;mailto&#8221; click Use Gmail
  7. Click Ok
  8. Restart Firefox and whenever you click a Mailto link you should now be redirected to Gmail&#8217;s compose page!
