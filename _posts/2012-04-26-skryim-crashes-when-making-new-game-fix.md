Having issues with Skyrim, when you attempt to make a new game and it crashes? This is how I fixed it.

  1. Click Start
  2. Click Control Panel
  3. Click Sound (Hardware and Sound)
  4. Click on the Sound tab up the top.
  5. Select your default Sound playback device and click Properties.
  6. Click on Advanced
  7. Set the Default Format to:Â 44.1khz 16bit
  8. Click Ok
