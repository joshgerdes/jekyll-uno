Having problems and your trying to install Microsoft Security Essentials and it just won&#8217;t install? I have ran into this issue and this is how I repaired it.

  1. First, you need to download the <a title="Windows Installer Cleanup Utility" href="http://majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=4459" target="_blank">Windows Installer Cleanup Utility</a>
  2. Run the utility and select Microsoft Antimalware
  3. Click Remove
  4. Click Ok then restart the computer
  5. Attempt Security Essentials install.
