To repair this follow the guide below:

  1. Open the Brother tray door(where you insert the Toner)
  2. Press and hold the Go button, until all the Lights are on.
  3. Release Go button and close the tray door

_Some people have also reported that with some models you actually have to remove the Toner unit before the reset will work, so if the above doesn&#8217;t work try again with the Toner unit out._
