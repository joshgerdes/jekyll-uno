Trying to either install Diablo 3 or update it and you are getting an error &#8220;appears to be corrupt&#8221; that is preventing the game from installing or updating?  This issue is usually caused by a speed decrease in the download speed of the file (usually occurred by either Blizzards servers or your own internet connection)_ try the following below to fix it.

  1. First thing, **delete** the **corrupted** **update** file and resume your Diablo install/update (C:Program Files (x86)Diablo IIIUpdates)

  1. Another option is to **install** the **game** in a **separate folder** or if possible hard drive , so instead of installing it in C:Program Files (x86) install it to C:Diablo III

If you still get the same issue it has been reported that removing the update file and trying again till you get a better server connection has worked but not guaranteed._
