Trying to burn an Audio CD but Windows Media Player keeps burning them as Data MP3 disks? This is how you fix it.

  1. Open Windows Media Player
  2. Click the small little tab below Burn up the top and select Audio CD
  3. That&#8217;s it! Now drag the files onto the burn list on the right, burn and you are good to go!
