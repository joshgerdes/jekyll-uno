  1. Face the back of the computer towards you.
  2. **Removed** the **screw** above the power port
  3. **Removed** the **screw** right next to the IR Out
  4. **Hold** the side **casing** of the computer and **slide** it towards **you**
  5. You have now removed the casing and can access the Power Supply/DVD Drive etc.
