Trying to add your Google Account to your Android phone and it&#8217;s coming up with the error &#8220;Can’t establish a reliable data connection to the server&#8221; try the tips below:

  1. Go into Applications and select the Youtube Application
  2. Login using your Google Account
  3. Wait for about one minute, while the Youtube application syncs your data.
  4. Close the Youtube application
  5. Open Settings
  6. Go to Accounts
  7. Now your Google Account should be listed, if it is not, attempt to add it _(you should now be able to)_
  8. . Add YouTube app and login with gmail account

If that does not work, try the following:

  1. Turn your mobile phone off
  2. Take out your Sim Card
  3. Start your phone _(without Sim card)_
  4. Click on Settings
  5. Click on Accounts
  6. Now attempt to add your Google Account
  7. Once the account has been added power off your phone and put your Sim card back in.

If that does not work it has been reported a Factory Reset _(which you will lose all your data/contacts) _will work.
