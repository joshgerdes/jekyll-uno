  1. At the back of the PS3, **turn** the **Power** switch **OFF**
  2. **Hold** down the **Eject** Power and **Power** button at the same time.
  3. While **holding** down both the eject and power buttons, **switch** the PS3 **on** (Switch at the back)
  4. **Hold** the **buttons** down for **_8 seconds_**; it should now force the DVD to eject.
