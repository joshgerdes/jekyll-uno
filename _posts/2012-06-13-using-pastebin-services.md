_Pastebin service allows people to upload text, code for public viewing. Very handy when you want someone&#8217;s opinion on something you have written or having problems with certain code and require help._

_Below are several recommended Pastebin services_

<a title="slexy pastebin" href="http://www.slexy.org" target="_blank"><strong>Slexy</strong></a>

Slexy.org is a powerful, slick, and sexy pastebin designed with the user in mind.

_Use Slexy.org to paste errors for debugging, show off your code or your tech specs, or share anything else with other Internet users worldwide._

_Top features: Tabbing within pastes, pasting through CLI/terminal using PastebinIt, saving preferences_

_More features: Paste expiration, paste versioning, line numbers/highlighting, code syntax highlighting, private pastes_

_Don&#8217;t worry about those slow pastebins with long URLs, ugly syntax highlighting, messy layouts, and lack of features. With Slexy.org, speed, efficiency, and usefulness are the goals._
