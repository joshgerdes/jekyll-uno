I recently gave a presentation on Entity Framework performance for the guys at work and one of my colleagues suggested I turned it a cheat sheet, so here goes:

![During your everyday coding]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/{{page.date | date: '%Y' }}/ef-cheat-sheet-everyday.png)

![When you are not meeting performance goals]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/{{page.date | date: '%Y' }}/ef-cheat-sheet-performance-options.png)

![If you need to squeeze every last drop of performance]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/{{page.date | date: '%Y' }}/ef-cheat-sheet-max-performance.png)

A PDF version of this can be found [**here**]({{site.baseurl}}/files/posts/{{page.date | date: '%Y' }}/EF%20Performance%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf).

A big thanks to [Thomas Coats](http://thomascoats.com/) for his help with this.
