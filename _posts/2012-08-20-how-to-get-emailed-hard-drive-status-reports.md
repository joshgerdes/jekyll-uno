_Want to get emailed disk status reports of your drives/hard drives and you are using a Windows PC? Using a great tool developed by Acronis you can. Acronis Drive Monitor runs down in the notification tray (by the time) and monitors your hard drive(s) temperature/spin time and sector failure rate giving you a good indication of when/if they are going to fail before they do. If you are away from the computer or simply would rather get status reports emailed to you, this is how you do it._

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    First things first download <a title="Acronis Drive Monitor" href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/drive-monitor/#overview" target="_blank">Acronis Drive Monitor</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Install</strong> <strong><em>Acronis Drive Monitor</em></strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Down by the <strong>notification</strong> <strong>tray</strong> you will see a little <strong>icon</strong> of a hard drive, <strong>double click it</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    To view the status of your disks click “Show Disks” you will get an overview on the drive(s) health, clicking on S.M.A.R.T parameters gives you more of an advanced look.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <strong>Options</strong> <em>(up the top of Acronis Disk Monitor)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    On the <strong>Alerts</strong> tab, click “<strong><em>change settings</em></strong>”
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Type</strong> in the email <strong>address</strong> you would like them <strong>sent</strong> <strong>to</strong> you can have multiple addresses by separated them with a semicolon.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Type</strong> in the <strong>from</strong> field who you want them <strong>sent from </strong>(<em>ie Home Computer)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <strong>outgoing</strong> <strong>mail</strong> <strong>server</strong> <strong>settings</strong> you have to type the outgoing mail settings for the email account you wish to use to send from, the easiest way is to check your mail client for the ones used there and copy them in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Sent <strong>Test</strong> <strong>Message</strong> to email a test email to the email address you specified above. Once it has been setup click <strong>Ok</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can select to be either emailed about Critical Events <em>(which stops email spamming in your inbox)</em> or you can either have regular disk status reports sent <em>(for a Windows server it is probably better for this to be selected so then you can go back and have a look at drive status if needed.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Congratulations you have just set up your computer to email hard drive alerts.
  </li>
</ol>

_Note: One of the adjustments I make for my home computer, is to disable Backup alerts (under Backup Monitoring)_
