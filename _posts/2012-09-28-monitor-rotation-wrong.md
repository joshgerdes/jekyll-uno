_Having problems where your monitor rotation is wrong, such as the start menu ending up upside down at the top of the screen? Follow the instructions below to repair._

Common fix for those using an Intel graphics driver, try the following Key combination:

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    On the keyboard, press and hold the: <strong>CTRL+ALT</strong> key then <strong>hold</strong> down the <strong>UP-ARROW</strong> button, to <strong>switch</strong> the <strong>screen</strong> <strong>rotation</strong>, keep <strong>pressing</strong> the UP-<strong>ARROW</strong> till you get your desired <strong>rotation</strong>.
  </li>
</ol>

_If the step above didn’t work, try this:_

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Look for the Time on the Start Bar
  </li>
  <li>
    Around the time will be small little icons, now position your mouse you might have to put it sideways and click to reveal any hidden icons on the small arrow.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look for the Graphics driver tray icon, it might be nVidia<em> (which is a green icon)</em> or ATI <em>(which is a red icon)</em> and right click it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Left click Rotation
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose Normal
  </li>
  <li>
    Press Ok<em> (within 15 seconds)</em> on the dialog Window that opens to accept the changes if your rotation is now the right way.
  </li>
</ol>
