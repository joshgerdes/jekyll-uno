_Trying to install Microsoft Security Essentials and it is complaining about not having genuine Windows? Attempting to run the Windows Genuine Advantage validation and you are ending up with a blank screen? This is usually caused when your Time/Date is out._

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Double left click on the <strong>Time/Date</strong> <em>(Lower right of your screen)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Make  any adjustments, make sure that Year/Month and Day <strong>is</strong> <strong>correct</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Ok
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run</strong> the WGA (Windows Genuine Advantage) <strong>validation</strong> <strong>again</strong>.
  </li>
</ol>
