<ol start="1">
  <li>
    To send other people your Countdown Shopping list, do the following:
  </li>
  <li>
    First <em>(You have to have either a Bluetooth pair with the device or Internet access for email, going to run this guide through the email way but similar to other methods)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to the Countdown <strong>application</strong> on your phone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Select</strong> my <strong>lists</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Select</strong> the <strong>list</strong> you want to <strong>send</strong> for someone <em>(for example Master List)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you need to <strong>open</strong> up the Countdown <strong>menu</strong> <em>(so on your phone click the Menu button, for example on the Galaxy Ace it is the button with Lines going down on the left hand side of the phone)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Select <strong>Share</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you need to <strong>select</strong> your <strong>sharing</strong> <strong>method</strong>, in this case we are going to use Email so select “Email to a friend<em>”  (Other methods Bluetooth/Dropbox/Gmail etc are located under Share with another app user)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Select Gmail or what email application you use on your phone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now enter in the email address of the person you are going to send it to and send.
  </li>
  <li>
    The other person simply needs to open the email on their phone and click the link in the email <em>(to the attached TXT document)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    When it selects what program to open it with, select your Web Browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Countdown Shopping app will then launch and <strong>import</strong> the list
  </li>
</ol>
