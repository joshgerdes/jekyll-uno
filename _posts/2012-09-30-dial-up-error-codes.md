803 &#8211; The PEAP configuration stored in the session cookie does not match the current session configuration.

804 &#8211; The PEAP identity stored in the session cookie does not match the current identity.

805 &#8211; You cannot dial using this connection at logon time, because it is configured to use logged on user&#8217;s credentials.

806 &#8211; A connection between your computer and the VPN server has been started, but the VPN connection cannot be completed. The most common cause for this is that at least one Internet device (for example, a firewall or a router) between your computer and the VPN server is not configured to allow Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol packets. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator or Internet service provider.

807 &#8211; The network connection between your computer and the VPN server was interrupted. This can be caused by a problem in the VPN transmission and is commonly the result of internet latency or simply that your VPN server has reached capacity. Please try to reconnect to the VPN server. If this problem persists, contact the VPN administrator and analyze quality of network connectivity.

808 &#8211; The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established because the remote server refused the connection. This is typically caused by a mismatch between the server&#8217;s configuration and your connection settings. Please contact the remote server&#8217;s Administrator to verify the server configuration and your connection settings.

809 &#8211; The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established because the remote server is not responding. This could be because one of the network devices (e.g., firewalls, NAT, routers, etc.) between your computer and the remote server is not configured to allow VPN connections. Please contact your Administrator or your service provider to determine which device may be causing the problem.

810 &#8211; A network connection between your computer and the VPN server was started, but the VPN connection was not completed. This is typically caused by the use of an incorrect or expired certificate for authentication between the client and the server. Please contact your Administrator to ensure that the certificate being used for authentication is valid.

811 &#8211; The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established because the remote server is not responding. This is typically caused by a pre-shared key problem between the client and server. A pre-shared key is used to guarantee you are who you say you are in an IP Security (IPSec) communication cycle. Please get the assistance of your administrator to determine where the pre-shared key problem is originating.

812 &#8211; The connection was prevented because of a policy configured on your RAS/VPN server. Specifically, the authentication method used by the server to verify your username and password may not match the authentication method configured in your connection profile. Please contact the Administrator of the RAS server and notify them of this error.

813 &#8211; You have attempted to establish a second broadband connection while a previous broadband connection is already established using the same device or port. Please disconnect the earlier connection and then re-establish the connection.

814 &#8211; The underlying Ethernet connectivity required for the broadband connection was not found. Please install and enable the Ethernet adapter on your computer via the Network Connections folder before attempting this connection.

815 &#8211; Failed to connect.
  
815 &#8211; The broadband network connection could not be established on your computer because the remote server is not responding. This could be caused by an invalid value for the &#8216;Service Name&#8217; field for this connection. Please contact your Internet Service Provider and inquire about the correct value for this field and update it in the Connection Properties.

816 &#8211; A feature or setting you have tried to enable is no longer supported by the remote access service.

817 &#8211; Cannot delete a connection while it is connected.

818 &#8211; The Network Access Protection (NAP) enforcement client could not create system resources for remote access connections. Some network services or resources might not be available. If the problem persists, disconnect and retry the remote access connection or contact the administrator for the remote access server.

819 &#8211; The Network Access Protection Agent (NAP Agent) service has been disabled or is not installed on this computer. Some network services or resources might not be available. If the problem persists, disconnect and retry the remote access connection or contact the administrator for the remote access server.

820 &#8211; The Network Access Protection (NAP) enforcement client failed to register with the Network Access Protection Agent (NAP Agent) service. Some network services or resources might not be available. If the problem persists, disconnect and retry the remote access connection or contact the administrator for the remote access server.

821 &#8211; The Network Access Protection (NAP) enforcement client was unable to process the request because the remote access connection does not exist. Retry the remote access connection. If the problem persists, make sure that you can connect to the Internet, and then contact the administrator for the remote access server.

822 &#8211; The Network Access Protection (NAP) enforcement client did not respond. Some network services or resources might not be available. If the problem persists, disconnect and retry the remote access connection or contact the administrator for the remote access server.

824 &#8211; Crypto-Binding TLV is not received.

826 &#8211; EAPTLS validation of the cached credentials failed. Please discard cached credentials.

827 &#8211; The L2TP/IPsec connection cannot be completed because the IKE and AuthIP IPSec Keying Modules service and/or the Base Filtering Engine service is not running. These services are required to establish an L2TP/IPSec connection. Please ensure that these services have been started before dialling the connection
