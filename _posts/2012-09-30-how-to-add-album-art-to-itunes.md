_Sometimes Album art may not be avaliable or you would like to add your own here is how you do it._

  2. **Right**&#8211;**click** the **album** whose album art you wish to change. **Select** **Get** **Info**.
  3. When asked if you are sure you want to edit information for multiple items, click the Yes button.
  4. Go to the **Artwork** section and double-click on it.
  5. **Browse** to the desired album **art** and click the **Open** button.
  6. The songs will be updated with the new album art and it will then be displayed in your Music Library.
