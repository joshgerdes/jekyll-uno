1. They will not do computer work outside of work hours, so don&#8217;t ask.
  
2. They do not fix coffee machines or vacuum cleaners
  
3. &#8220;It was working yesterday&#8221; is a fail excuse, everything always works until it doesn&#8217;t work. Hence why you are talking to them.
  
4. Everyone is urgent, and the excuse of not being able to talk on Facebook is not a valid excuse.
  
5. Using family as an excuse to get your computer fix is horrible, ever wonder why your family IT guy doesn&#8217;t like coming to family outings? You know why now.
  
6. It is not the technician’s fault your computer hardware/software has failed, don&#8217;t take it out on them.
  
7. Starting the conversation with asking for someone else, finding they aren&#8217;t there and saying &#8220;Well maybe you can help me&#8221; is not a good start to the conversation, just state what’s wrong from the start.
  
8. Be patient, if you want it fixed properly, don&#8217;t hassle the technician.
  
9. The supermarket is not the technician’s workspace so don&#8217;t ask questions.
  
10. Computers have many forms, so do not be grumpy or upset if they haven’t heard of your problem before.
