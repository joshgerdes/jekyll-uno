I believe the Information Technology infrastructure in five years will look bright with the promise of tomorrow.


  <li>
    With the latest shiny gadgets accessible with a low price range and top of the line features the ability to look up the latest product trends, product information and customer information will be as simple as breathing.
  </li>
  <li>
    With the latest tablet technology showing off products and information with media with become second nature with customers getting the full picture on products with a few finger presses.
  </li>
  <li>
    Online shopping will become standard with more stores joining the fro allowing for products delivered straight to your doorstep at completive pricing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Paying bills and purchasing will become easier allowing for not only EFTPOS but with more phone pay stations using services such as Google Wallet at disposal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cell phones will be able to be used for booking items or tickets while in queues with local supermarkets and retail outlets offering free Wi-Fi.
  </li>
  <li>
    QR Codes will become more common place, allowing customers to not only get more information but special deals on products and services
  </li>
  <li>
    Cloud based systems will become common place with thin clients allowing access to client information, documents and emails both remotely and securely.
  </li>
  <li>
    Servers will become more virtualized allowing for faster processing and stability.
  </li>
</ol>
