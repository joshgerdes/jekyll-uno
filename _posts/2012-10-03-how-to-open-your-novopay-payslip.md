The Novopay payslip is a PDF _(portable document format)_ and requires <a title="Acrobat Reader" href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/" target="_blank">Acrobat Reader to ru</a>n.

  1. When you open your email payslip and click on the attachment (which is your payslip) you will be prompted with having to type in a password.
  2. Your password is your MOE _(Ministry of Education)_ number and is generally 7 digits, if however your MOE number is shorter you need to add the appropriate amount of zeros in front of the number to make up 7 digits.
  3. Clicking Ok or pressing Enter will cause your payslip to open.

_Note: As been reported by a few teachers you might find your payslip is corrupted in which case you need to contact your school administrator and get them to resend your payslip for the appropriate month._
