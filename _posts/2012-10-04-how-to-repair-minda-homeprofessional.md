Basically you need to download the latest version of Minda from <a title="LIC" href="http://www.lic.co.nz" target="_blank">LIC </a>(lic.co.nz) and in order to do this you need your PART _(participant)_ code and your Minda PIN to login.

  1. Once you have logged in to the LIC website and greeted with “Welcome <insertnamehere>” click “Get MINDA Software” – on the left hand side.
  2. Then click the blue download button titled “Click here to download the latest version of MINDA”.
  3. It will then download minda.exe and all you need to do is run it, say Yes to any prompts and it will install/repair Minda and the Firebird server.
