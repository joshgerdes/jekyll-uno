_Attempting to install applications from the Google Store and getting Error 921? I got this after several OS reinstalls on my phone and installing the same apps several time._

  1. In order to fix this, you need to go into **Settings**
  2. **Accounts**
  3. **Remove** your **Google** **Account**
  4. Then re-**add** your **account**

_Now you should be able to download and install the applications you are after._
