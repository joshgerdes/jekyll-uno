Things you will need.

  * Small Razor Blade

<div>
  <em>or</em>
</div>

  * Small Flat-Head Screwdriver

<div>
</div>

  1. Unplug the Aspire One battery _(to avoid any chances of the laptop turning on while you are working on it)._
  2. On the right hand side of the Keyboard you should see several notches, get your Razor Blade and gently pry the keyboard up over the notches.
  3. Once lifted push the little notch in the top middle of the keyboard in and slide the keyboard out.

_Note: It is normal for the Laptop keyboard cable to be “bent” to fix in the slot._
