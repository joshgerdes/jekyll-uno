Every time you open Google Chrome you’re getting the “Your profile could not be opened correctly” error? This is how I fixed it.

  1. Open **My Computer/Computer**
  2. Go into your operating system drive (usually Local Disk C:)
  3. Go to _**Users/Documents & Settings**_
  4. Go into your user account (for example: C:Usersluke)
  5. Navigate to: **AppDataLocalGoogleChromeUser DataDefault**
  6. **Delete** **WebData**

_If you are running Windows XP navigate to: Application DataLocalGoogleChromeUserDataDefault._

_Note: Default is the name of the Google profile; it may be different depending on your setup._
