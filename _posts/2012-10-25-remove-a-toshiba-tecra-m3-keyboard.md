What you need

* Philips Screwdriver
* Small Razor Blade/Flat-Head Screwdriver

  1. Remove the Laptop Battery (to prevent laptop from getting bumped and turning on).
  2. On the casing of the laptop _(just above the keyboard â€“where the power button is located)_locate a little notch on either side and lift. Gently remove the plastic casing.
  3. You should now be able to see 2 screws _(on either side of the top laptop)_ and unscrew them.
  4. Put your fingers on either side of the top part of the keyboard and gently lift upwards
  5. Lift the keyboard out and unplug it.
