  1. Turn the laptop over so you have the bottom of the laptop facing up _(I recommend placing on a soft surface such as a towel to avoid any scratches to the chassis._
  2. Move the battery latch right – to unlock the bottom panel.
  3. Now on the top of the panel _(bottom cover)_ gently lift up.
  4. You should now have access to the 2.5” HDD.
