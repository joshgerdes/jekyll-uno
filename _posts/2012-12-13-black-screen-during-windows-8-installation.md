This issue occurs when Windows 8 switches to UEFI install mode â€“ on a non-compatible motherboard. This is commonly caused by multiple HDDs plugged in during boot. Follow the guide below to fix it.

  1. **Unplug** any secondary **HDDs** (Hard drives) from your computer and leave the operating system HDD in.
  2. **Begin** the **installation** again &#8211; the install should automatically change the install to master boot record.
  3. Once installed &#8211; turn computer off and plug your other HDDs in.
