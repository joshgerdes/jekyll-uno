  1. Turn the laptop upside down Â (_make sure it is resting against a soft surface, such as a towel.)_
  2. **Remove** the **battery**
  3. Behind the battery is an **orange** **slider**.
  4. **Slide** the orange slider **left**.
  5. Now **push** the **casing** **forward** _(towards the battery end)_
  6. The plastic casing will then slide off revealing the HDD and on-board CMOs battery.

Note: The HP Mini uses a 2.5&#8243; SATA HDD
