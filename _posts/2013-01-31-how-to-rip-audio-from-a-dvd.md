In this guide I am using a media player called: VLC (VideoLAN) to do the conversion – it can be downloaded free “<a title="VLC Media Player" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank">here</a>”.

  1. Once installed – open VLC media player
  2. Put the DVD you want to rip the audio into your computer
  3. Click **Media** _(up-the-top)_
  4. Click **Convert**/Save
  5. Click **Disc** _(up-the-top)_
  6. Make sure the DVD is selected
  7. Press **Convert/Save** _(down-the-bottom)_
  8. Change the destination file field to the location where you would like the audio saved to.
  9. In the **profile** drop down box select **Audio –MP3**
 10. Click **Start**

Note: Make sure you have the right stream selected in step 6 &#8211; or you might just record the Menu sound &#8211; for example: VOB\_1 compared to Vob\_0.
