This issue commonly occurs in Microsoft Outlook when Outlook has reached its file size limit. To fix this you need to allow Outlook to use a larger sized table.

  1. Launch Microsoft Outlook
  2. Right click the folder list (on the left hand side) and left click Properties.
  3. Click Advanced
  4. Check _“Allow upgrade to large tables”_.
  5. Click Ok
  6. Click Ok
  7. Restart Outlook

Note: You can also force emails to be deleted thereby clearing the Outlook table by selecting emails and select SHIFT-DEL at the same time.
