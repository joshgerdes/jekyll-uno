This happens when Windows Mail is using a different contacts list to the Windows Contacts â€“ such as a newsgroup.

  1. Open **Windows Mail**
  2. Click **Contacts** _(left hand side)_
  3. Click **Import**
  4. Click **From Windows Address Book**

Windows Mail will then import all your contacts into the address book restart Windows Mail and you should now be able to display and compose messages to your contacts.
