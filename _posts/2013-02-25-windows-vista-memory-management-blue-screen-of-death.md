The Windows Vista Memory Management BSOD _(Blue Screen Of Death)_ is usually caused by a faulty RAM _(Random Access Memory)_ module or a RAM module that has an incorrect or different speed then the other module which might be in the computer.

  * Download <a title="memtestx86" href="http://www.memtest86.com/download.htm" target="_blank">memtestx86 </a>and burn to a CD 
  * Boot from the CD and allow the scan to go â€“ any red lines indicate bad RAM. I suggest allowing the scan to go for 2 passes.
