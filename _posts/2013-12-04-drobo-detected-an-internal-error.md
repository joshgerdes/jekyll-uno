If you just had this error and are GASPING like I was at 10PM at night – never fear there is still hope!

Note: Tested with the Drobo 5N.
  
  1. Go to the [Drobo Support website](http://www.drobo.com/support/updates) & download the correct latest firmware for your Drobo.
  2. Take ALL the internal drives out of the Drobo _(this is to make sure your Drobo applications – even Drobo Port applications & storage are not affected)_.
  3. If you haven&#8217;t already got the Drobo Dashboard you can also download that from the Drobo Support website – Open the Drobo Dashboard.
  4. Wait 5 minutes till it scans the network and locates your Drobo.
  5. Once located click on your Drobo & select Tools within the Drobo dashboard.
  6. Click Manual Update
  7. Navigate to the location of the firmware update file and upgrade. This will require a restart.
  8. Once the process has completed restart the Drobo & reinsert your drives.
