Now with a nifty little application called – [Orbit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&hl=en) you can easily traffic HTTP (port 80) traffic & other random Android application traffic through the Tor network. Follow the guide below to get your android device & applications running through the Tor network. 

Note: This application needs root access for full functionality and is recommend.

  1. Open Play Store/Google Play on your android device. 
  2. Search for: Orbot. 
  3. Select – Orbot: Proxy with Tor _(from The Tor Project)_ & install it to your Android device. 
  4. Once installed – open Orbot. 
  5. Up the top of the application – click Settings 
  6. Make sure – Start Orbot on Boot is checked. 
  7. Scroll down to Transparent Proxying & make sure Transparent Proxying is enabled – then check Tor Everything to make sure all your application&#8217;s network traffic is directed to the Tor network. 
  8. Now – scroll right to the bottom of the settings and make sure in the Debug area – Network Auto-Sleep is checked to reduce battery consumption. 
  9. Go back to the main Orbot home screen and press the large silver power button to start proxying your traffic through the Tor network. 

Note: You can confirm the traffic is being proxyed by monitoring the Download & Upload traffic on the bottom half of the Orbot screen.
