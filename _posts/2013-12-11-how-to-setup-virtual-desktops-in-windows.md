First you need a third party utility called – Dexpot. This utility is free for non-commercial use & can be obtained from: <a href="http://Dexpot.de" target="_blank">Dexpot.de</a>. 

  1. Once downloaded – run the installation file to install. 
  2. Click Next & I Agree to accept the license agreement. 
  3. Select Private Use for home use – if you are using this commercially you can select Commercial Use (30 day trial) and select next. 
  4. Make sure the Destination folder is correct (default path is: C:Program Files (x86)Dexpot for 64bit machines) and select Next. 
  5. Uncheck – I accept the Terms of the Tune-up Utilities box to prevent grey ware from being installed & select Next to actually start the installation process. 
  6. Once installation has completed – Click Finish to launch Dexpot. 
  7. On your Taskbar you will now have 4 Virtual Desktops – you can select each one to navigate back & forth between them. 
  8. 
  9. You are now running Virtual Desktops!
