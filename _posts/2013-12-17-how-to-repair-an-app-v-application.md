  1. In Windows – click on the notification tray by the time.
  2. Double click on the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) client
  3. You will be greeted with the Virtual Application Management dialog – press VIRTUAL APPS
  4. On the right hand side – under the progress bar select Repair
  5. This will start a Repair-AppvClientPackage script to repair & &#8220;redeploy&#8221; the application back to the user.

&nbsp;

Note: The repair will not work if the application process is running. Make sure it is fully closed in the Windows task manager before attempting the repair.
