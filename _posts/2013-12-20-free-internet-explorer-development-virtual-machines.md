I have recently found a good web resource – 90 day restricted Virtual Machines, compatible with Hyper-V/VMWare & Virtual box that I thought I would share. 

These Virtual Machines are intended for web development testing and include Windows XP machines running Internet Explorer 6 to Windows 8.1 machines running Internet Explorer 11 _(as of this post)_. 

  1. To access these Virtual Machines – go to: <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/" target="_blank">Modern.ie</a> and select &#8220;Get Free VMs&#8221; to see the download list. 

Note: This website also has a modern interface – with a lot of resources for webpage development in Internet Explorer. Useful for any webpage builder and is developed by Microsoft.
