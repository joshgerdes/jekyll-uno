  1. Launch a Terminal 
  2. Type in: **_sudo apt-get update_**  
   (this will ping all the upgrade mirrors to determine if they are live and what upgrade packages are available)
  3. Once completed – type in: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade _(this will start pooling down the various packages to do a distribution upgrade. Keep in mind – apt-get update will just do an update within the same distribution)._ 

Note: Ubuntu now has an Update Manager that is available by launching the Unity search function and typing in – Update Manager. This is a GUI method of upgrading. I have had failure with this method personally so recommend using the command line for distribution upgrades for more visibility.
