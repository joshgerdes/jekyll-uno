  1. Bring up the Metro Windows 8 interface <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /> </span>
  2. Type in: Programs & Features
  3. Select Turn Windows Features on or off on the left hand side menu
  4. Check Hyper-V _(make sure – Hyper-V Management Tools & Hyper-V platforms are also selected inside the Hyper-V section)_.
  5. Click Ok
  6. The Hyper-V services will get installed. Once completed restart your Surface.
  7. Launch the Hyper-V Manager and you are good to go to start playing with your Virtual machines.

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Note: The same method allows Hyper-V to be installed on Windows 8.1 if you are running a 64bit OS & your Motherboard & CPU supports virtualization.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">Note: Surface RT does not support Hyper-V – this is only suitable for the Surface Pros.</span>
