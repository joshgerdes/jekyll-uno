Razer – a company well known for its PC gaming peripherals.

With its sleep black and green designs Razer has captivated many a gamer – including myself as I type this using my Razer Blackwidow keyboard.

Now &#8211; out of nowhere the company has released concepts for two products – the <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/nabu" target="_blank">Razer Nabu</a> a digital wristband that connects to your mobile phone offering various options – and <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/christine" target="_blank">Project Christine</a> the modular PC design.

Computer components themselves are of a modular design – as soon as they are compatible with each other you can swap and upgrade most parts – Project Christine takes this modular design further in a fashion that reminds me of lego.


## <span id="Simplicity">Simplicity</span>

  * The design like all of Razers products is simple yet aesthetically pleasing.
  * Modular – pick & part parts – want another CPU or SSD? Simply plug it in.

## <span id="Future_proofish">Future proof<em>(ish)<br /> </em></span>

  * Razer are claiming that when technology changes so do the modular modules.
  * Up to date technology with the latest brand GFX & CPU chipsets.

## <span id="Silent_Cool">Silent & Cool</span>

  * Each modular component will feature inbuilt water cooling.
  * The water cooling will allow the components to be cool and quiet.
  * As an added note – the water cooled components will most likely make purchasing the modules already overclocked easier.

## <span id="The_Downside">The Downside</span>

  * It is only a concept and prototype at the moment – usual Razer product lines seem to take 1 year to hit the shelves. This will probably be a 2015 product.
  * Even though the modules will connect via the PCI-E BUS this will depend on manufacturers reselling Project Christine part &#8220;modules&#8221;.
  * No pricing has been released yet.

All in all – I quite enjoy the look of Project Christine and may well see it in my office space next year.
