Help & Manual allows documents to be published to multiple formats – such as ePub & CHM easily. 

  1. First open the Project you want to publish _(in this guide I am using the Get\_Me\_Started example project).
  2. Click on Publish (top menu) 
  3. Under Publish Format – select Apple iBooks (ePUB Format) 
  4. Then select Publish Now.
