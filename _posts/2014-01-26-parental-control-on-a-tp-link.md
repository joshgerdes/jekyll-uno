In this example I am using a &#8211; TD-W8960N<span style="color: black;font-family: Arial;font-size: 9pt;background-color: #fafafa">.</span>
  
_I am only going to give you a brief outline on how to set this up as various people need various settings – however it is extremely easy to utilise and doesn&#8217;t require a router restart to take effect._<span style="color: black;font-family: Arial;font-size: 9pt;background-color: #fafafa"><br /> </span>

  1. First navigate to the routers administration page – open your internet browser and navigate to: 192.168.1.1
  2. On the left hand side Menu select Advanced Setup
  3. Select Parental Control
  4. Here you have 2 options – you can place a Time Restriction which will allow you to specify by time and day _(by MAC address filtering)_ that will Block or Allow internet connectivity during certain periods. The second is URL filtering allowing you to place a block on certain URLs.
