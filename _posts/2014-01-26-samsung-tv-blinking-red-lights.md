  1. Unplug your TV from the power for 5 minutes to allow for power capacitors to clear charge. 
  2. Plug TV back into power and press the on button. 

Note: If this fails to turn the TV on and blinking red lights still insist – contact your manufacturer or local television repair store. A few Samsung models _(such as the Samsung Series 6 LCD sets)_ are well known for faulty capacitors which causes this problem.
