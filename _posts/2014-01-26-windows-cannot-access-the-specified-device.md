Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item. 

There are several different fixes to try for this – I have listed them below. 

  1. Open Internet Explorer 
  2. Click on Tools 
  3. Click on Internet Options 
  4. Select Internet and click Custom Level 
  5. In the Miscellaneous section, set the &#8216;Launching applications and unsafe files&#8217; to Prompt 

Also try 

  1. Right clicking on the file you are attempting to open and select &#8220;Unblock&#8221;. 

Also try 

  1. Renaming the filename of the file you are attempting to access to contain less than 8 characters 

Also try 

  1. Reinstalling your antivirus – commonly caused by Trend & AVG Antivirus
