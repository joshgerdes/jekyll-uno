<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt">Deleting the Auto Complete entries in Google Chrome is very useful – especially if you are like me and wasn&#8217;t paying attention and misspelt a username that would have forever been popping up in the login field.<br /> </span>

  1. Open Chrome 
  2. Navigate to the login webpage of the autocomplete details you would like to remove. 
  3. Start typing to bring up the name you want to remove 
  4. Using the Arrow keys navigate to select the entry you would like to remove 
  5. Press SHIFT+DELETE _(if you are using OSX – you can press FN+SHIFT+DEL)_ keys at the same time to permanently remove these details from Google Chromes cache. 

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt">You have now stopped that autocomplete entry from forever reminding you of that misspell!</span>
