  7. Check Windows Gadget Platform 
  8. Press Ok 
  9. Your PC will restart and gadgets will be re-enabled. 

_Note: Although originally enabled in Windows 7 â€“ Microsoft had deactivated the gadgets due to unstable/malicious code that allowed unsavoury individuals remote access to the PC. If re-enabled make you are running the latest Windows Update and the Windows Firewall service is enabled._
