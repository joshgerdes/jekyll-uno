On the Performance tab you can configure the following settings:
  
Compression level
  
You can choose the compression level for a backup:

  * None &#8211; the data will be copied without any compression, which may significantly increase the backup file size.
  * Normal &#8211; the recommended data compression level (set by default).
  * High &#8211; higher backup file compression level, takes more time to create a backup.
  * Maximum &#8211; maximum backup compression, but takes a long time to create a backup.

The optimal data compression level depends on the type of files stored in the backup. For example, even maximum compression will not significantly reduce the backup size, if the backup contains essentially compressed files, like .jpg, .pdf or .mp3
