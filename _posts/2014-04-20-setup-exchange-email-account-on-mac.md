Having access to an exchange mailbox on a Mac or iMac is very useful – especially if you are a designer in a prominent Windows domain environment – setup exchange email account on mac is incredibly easy on the client site – as long as the relevant ports have been opened up allowing you to connect from outside a Windows domain.

&nbsp;

  1. Open the **Apple** menu
  2. Click **System** **Preferences**
  3. Click **Internet Accounts**.
  4. Click the **Add (+)** button.
  5. Click **Exchange** in the list of services.
  6. **Enter** the **information**.
  7. Click **Continue**.
  8. **Enter** a **description** **for** the **account** (for example, Work or Exchange).
  9. In the **Server** **Address** field, **enter** the **fully** **qualified** **domain** **name** (FQDN) for the companies exchange server.
 10. Click **Continue**.
 11. Make sure the Contacts and Calendar checkboxes are selected to automatically set up those apps.
 12. Click **Done**.
