Update caching on OSX server can be easily managed through the Server application.

It is recommended to turn on updating caching to allow osx clients to be able to draw Apple updates from the server without having to branch out onto the internet – decreasing broadband data usage and network traffic.

&nbsp;

  1. Navigate to: **Applications**
  2. Open **Server**
  3. Select **Caching**
  4. Click **On/Off** to turn on the Software Update caching service
