The Lync Server Control panel is used to control most Lync user policies and settings so when the Lync Server control is blank – it causes an issue with maintaining and configuring the Lync server.

  1. The Lync Server control panel relies on the [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) dependency in order to display properly &#8211; if your Lync Server Control Panel is blank &#8211; install Silverlight and restart the control panel.
