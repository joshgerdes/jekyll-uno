As part of my role at work – we continuously swap the company’s mobile phone – a Nokia windows phone so being able to reset Nokia windows phone to factory settings is quite useful as we store our contacts on the SIM card so restoring the phone back to factory settings before handing them on is a useful occurrence.

** **

**Warning:** _This erases all personal content on your phone and restores the factory settings._

_Make sure the charger is disconnected, and switch your phone off._

&nbsp;

  1. Press and hold the **volume down** key, and connect the charger. The screen will show an exclamation mark (**!**).
  2. Press the keys in the following order: **volume up**, **volume down**, **power**, and **volume down**. Your phone resets, and boots up. This may take several minutes.
