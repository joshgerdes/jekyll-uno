Imaging computers using Windows Deployment Services or System Center – can be painful when you don’t know the MAC address of a computer finding a MAC address through PXE boot can be quite useful – this needs to be done from the physical workstation.

&nbsp;

  1. **Start** the **computer**
  2. Tap **F12** to start network boot as soon as the computer starts to boot
  3. You should get to a black screen with some white writing – select Pause/Break on your keyboard to pause this screen the MAC address should display.
