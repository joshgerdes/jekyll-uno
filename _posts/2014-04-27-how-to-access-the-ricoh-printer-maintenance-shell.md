Most Ricoh network capable printers include a Telnet server that is used by Ricoh for maintenance of their printers allowing you to access the Ricoh Printer maintenance shell. Using telnet or in my guide – I am using the third party tool pUTTY _(as in my domain environment – telnet hasn’t been installed on most workstations)_ you can access the Maintenance Shell.

  1. Download and run [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).
  2. **Open** **PuTTY** and choose **Telnet** under Connection Type.
  3. **Type** **in** the IP **address** or hostname in the Host Name (or IP address field).
  4. Click **Open**.
  5. This will then start the RICOH Maintenance Shell – type in the login name _(default is using admin as the username – and a blank password).
  6. You will be greeted with the maintenance shell.
