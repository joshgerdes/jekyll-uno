Adjusting Java Security settings can be used to fix a variety of problems – especially around certification validation and problems with java security updates. However although not recommended for security reasons it can be used as a “quick fix” or “work around” until a permanent solution can be found and also just takes a few clicks of the mouse to change.

  1. Click **Start**
  2. Click **Control Panel**
  3. Click on the View by: option – top right and select Small icons
  4. Click **Java (32-Bit)**
  5. Up the top – click **Security**
  6. **Change** the Security Level **slider** to **Medium**
  7. Click **Apply** (down the bottom)
