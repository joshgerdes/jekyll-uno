Have a new Sickbeard installation and want to migrate or move your Library and settings across?

Due to the nature of the Sickbeard application – migrating Sickbeard data from one install to another is very easy.

  1. On the Sickbeard install you want to use as your source – open the folder where Sickbeard is installed and **copy** the following **files** **to** the same location on your **destination** **Sickbeard** **install** **and** **overwrite** the ones that are there.


  * **sickbeard.db**
  * **config.ini**
  * **autoProcessTV/autoProcessTV.cfg** (if you use it)

_Note: Tested on: Sickbeard Alpha Build 504_
