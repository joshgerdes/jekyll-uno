As most MMORG out these days &#8211; Wildstar allows addons.

  1. The first and easiest way is to use the Curse Gaming Client to install addons.
  2. The second is to download the addons and extract the ZIP file to: %appdata%/NCSOFT/Wildstar/Addons

Note: If the Addons folder does not exist &#8211; you will need to create it.
