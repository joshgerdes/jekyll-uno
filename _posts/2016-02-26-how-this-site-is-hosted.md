A brief overview on the small amount of infrastructure powering this site.

### Topology
![Topology Diagram](/images/alexmgraham_com_topology.png)

### Cloudfront with ACM
I am using a free Wildcard SSL certificate from Amazon Certificate Manager combined with [Cloudfront][cloudfront]. 
This might seem like a waste since Github pages are already [served from a CDN.][pages_cdn], but my main goal here was to use SSL on a custom domain. 
Cloudfront is setup to respect all cache headers from Github (Currently 600s) so we should end up serving most requests from cache.

### Github Pages and Jekyll
* Powered by a static site generator called [Jekyll][jekyll].
* The source for this website is [hosted on Github][alexmgraham_repo].
* The beautifully simplistic theme is [jekyll-uno by Josh Gerdes][jekyll-uno].
* [Github pages][github-pages] automatically compiles and serves the static HTML pages whenever a change is uploaded.


### Costs
* Github Pages: Free!
* SSL Certificate: Free!
* Cloudfront: $0.085/GB (Data Usage TBD)

Overall I estimate that the costs should be pennies per month as I do not expect much traffic.
