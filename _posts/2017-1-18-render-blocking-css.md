I came across this great resource a few weeks ago. It is about techniques used to eliminate render blocking CSS. It is really easy to read and understand and you can start applying the methods immediately. Hence I wanted to share this with you.

### What is render blocking?
Render in terms of web pages means, 'to load', so if something is render blocking it simply means there are things getting in the way of a smooth and fast loading page. Render blocking CSS delays the page from loading quickly. If you have large files the page will of course take even longer to load.

### What can we do about it?
The article I am about to link to written by [Patrick Sexton](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/render-blocking-css.html) explains how we can deal with it. I have applied some of the techniques mentioned and they have helped my website's page load speed tremendously.

### What to expect
1. HOW TO CALL CSS PROPERLY
2. LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF CSS FILES IN THE CRITICAL PATH
3. USING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CSS YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH
