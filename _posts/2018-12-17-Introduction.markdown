Thank you for tuning in! My name is Jonathan Johnson and I am currently a Cybersecurity Student at Southeast Missouri State University. 
One of my biggest hobbies and passions is InfoSec, so I thought I would create a blog that showed some of the projects I have done/cool discovries.

I will show a variety of different topics and projects, however I really enjoy Network Analysis, Malware Analysis, and Threat Analytics, so you might notice alot of them are centered around Threat Hunting/Analytics/Detection side.  That is the vertical I mainly surround myself in, but to get better in that area I have to explore all of the other verticles as well, so you will see some coding, Offensive Security, and more. 

Feel free to reach out to my email as well which is on the main page. 

Hope you enjoy,
Thank you for tuning in!
