Hi Friends, and welcome to my web site.

My name is Marco Fabbian and I'm a software developer, motorcyclist and tech passionate.
I lived in Dublin - Ireland for 3 years and then I moved to Zurich - Switzerland.
I've been living abroad for many years and I'm enjoying it.

I'm interested in software development, software quality, development methodologies (agile, waterfall, etc) 
and software architectures.

In my free time I love driving my motorcycle and travel arround the world.
