Do you ever want to add external Azure Active Directory or other users to specific boards in a project, but not want to give them access to the entire Azure DevOps Project?

Using the steps below, we can restrict users to a specific board.

1. Invite external users to DevOps org with Stakeholder access.
2. In the project, create a new Team and do not add it to the existing security group to inherit permissions.

3. Add external users to created Team.
4. Set permission for created Team properly. In this case, itâ€™s to set View project-level information to Allow.
