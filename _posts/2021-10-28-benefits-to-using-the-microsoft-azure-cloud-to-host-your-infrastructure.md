Cloud computing offers many benefits, from your traditional on-premises infrastructure, ecosystems such as Microsoft Azure, have an underlying fabric built for today's 'software as a service' or 'software denied' world.

The shift of technologies from managing on-premises Exchange environments for mail to consuming Microsoft 365 services has allowed more time for the IT and businesses to adopt, consume and improve their technology and continuously improve to get the most use of it to get ahead the competition.

Below is a high-level list of what I consider some of the benefits of using the Microsoft Azure ecosystem:

* Each Azure datacentre 'region' has 3 Availability Zones, each zone acts as a separate datacentre, giving redundant power and networking services, quickly allowing you to separate your services across different fault domains and zones, providing better resiliency, while also giving you the ability to keep them logically and physically close together.
* Geo-redundant replication of backups for Virtual Machines, PaaS/File Shares, and ability to do cross-region restore functionality (i.e., Australia/Australia East).
* A multitude of hosts (supporting both AMD and Intel workloads), which are continually patched and maintained, and tuned for virtualisation performance, stability and security, no longer do we need to spend hours patching, maintaining, licensing on-premises hypervisors, ever so increasing as these systems get targeted for vulnerabilities and architecting how many physical hosts, we may need to support a system.
* Consistent, up-to-date hardware, no need to worry about lead times for new hardware, purchasing new hardware every three years and procurement and implementation costs of hardware, allowing you to spend the time improving on the business and tuning your services _(scaling up and down, trying new technologies, turning off devices etc.)_
* For those that like to hoard every file that ever existed, the Azure platform allows scale _(in and out to suit your file sizes)_ along with cost-saving opportunities and tweaks with Automation and migrating files between cool/hot tiers.
* No need to pay datacentre hosting costs
* No need to worry about redundant switching
* With multiple hosts, there is no risk around air conditioning leaks, hardware failure; you don't need to worry about some of these unfortunate events occurring.
* No need to pay electricity costs to host your workloads.
* Reduced IT labour costs and time to implement and maintain systems
* OnDemand resources available can stand up separate networks unattached to your production network for testing or other devices easily without working out through VLANs or complex switching and firewalls.
* Azure Network have standard DDOS protection enabled by default
* Backups are secure by default; they are offline and managed by Microsoft, so if a ransomware attack occurs, won't be able to touch your backups.
* Constant Security recommendations, improvements built into the platform.
* Azure Files is geo-redundant and across multiple storage arrays, encrypted at rest.
