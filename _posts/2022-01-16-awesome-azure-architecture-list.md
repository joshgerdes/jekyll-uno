A very brief Blog article today, I have created an AWESOME-Azure-Architecture list, this list is hosted in Github and located here:

* [AWESOME-Azure-Architecture](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/awesome-azure-architecture/blob/main/README.md "AWESOME-Azure-Architecture")

This list is a curated list of AWESOME blogs, videos, tutorials, code, tools & scripts, related to the design and implementation of solutions in Microsoft Azure.

This list contains anything that can help with your **Microsoft Azure architecture** and quickly get you up and running when designing, planning, and implementing services that empower organisations around the planet to achieve more.
