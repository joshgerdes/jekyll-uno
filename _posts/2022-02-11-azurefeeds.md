Over the past few months, I have been busy working on a new project...

A news aggregator for Azure news and updates, I tested some desire for this using AzureFeeds, on [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azure-feeds-709457212/recent-activity/ "Azure Feeds - Linkedin"){:target="_blank"} as a platform _(which will continue)..._

I didn't want my LinkedIn connections, to be spammed by Azure updates every day, when some connections were connected to me for other non-Azure related services, so I created a separate account that interested people could subscribe to AzureFeeds.

I was lucky enough to acquire both [https://azureupdates.com](https://azureupdates.com "https://azureupdates.com"){:target="_blank"} and [https://azurefeeds.com/](https://azurefeeds.com/ "https://azurefeeds.com/"){:target="_blank"} and wanted to do something a bit more substantial than just forwarding to the relevant Microsoft pages.

Inspired by [PlanetPowerShell](https://www.planetpowershell.com/ "Planet PowerShell"){:target="_blank"}, I wanted an Azure specific service, so I created the [AzureFeeds](https://azurefeeds.com/ "Azure Feeds"){:target="_blank"} website.

Originally starting using official Microsoft services, due to the massive amount of updates and changes ongoing, I didn't want to make the feeds too busy, however with [feedback](https://twitter.com/lukemurraynz/status/1491139604879388673 "Twitter - Community or nah?"){:target="_blank"} from the community through a Twitter poll, I then added an author section and added community-based content to supplement official updates, mimicking the functionality of PlanetPowerShell being content community-driven a lot more.

You can subscribe to a single feed by clicking 'Download Feed' using your favourite RSS reader (even [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-are-rss-feeds-e8aaebc3-a0a7-40cd-9e10-88f9c1e74b97 " What are RSS feeds?")) and get the content delivered straight to you from official and community updates! Allowing you to keep up with Azure Updates and Azure community-driven updates easily, or just browse the webpage and filter by Author or Category for content that you may be after.
