The path to becoming a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com){:target="_blank"} _(Most Valuable Professional)_ is not as linear as some might think, others have a goal to receive the Microsoft MVP Award, and others have a passion for technology that shows in community activities such as speaking or user groups, helping others on forums, and helping to maintain documentation and helping others be up-to-speed with the ever changing ecosystem that is the Microsoft stack - it is not a one size fits all, just as there are multiple ways of learning, there are multiple ways to the MVP Award.

I join [Christian Buckley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAAGE0BlHRIKs-kft9wriNFsr-4V92iu-w){:target="_blank"} for **episode 167** of his **#MVPbuzChat** Podcast/Video chat, to tell my story, feel free to check it out _(if you can ignore the bad camera angle!)_ and other MVPs talk about their journey to the Microsoft MVP Award.
