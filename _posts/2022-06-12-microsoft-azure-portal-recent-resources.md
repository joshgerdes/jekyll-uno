The Microsoft Azure Portal displays a list of Recent resources _(whether they are subscriptions or Resources)_ you have accessed, usually when you first log in to the portal itself.

This capability makes it quick to access resources you use the most often, but sometimes you may want to view the resources in a list for easy access or clear the recent resources _(ie if you are going to do a presentation)_ - this is how you can do it.

The Azure portal has a service called: Recent, to access it.

1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/?l=en.en-nz#home "Microsoft Azure Portal"){:target="_blank"}
2. In the search bar type in: **Recent**
3. ![Azure Portal - Recent](/uploads/azureportal_searchrecent.png "Azure Portal - Recent")
4. Select **Recent**
5. You will be taken to the Recent Resources view, where you can select Clear to clear your Recent Resources, or you can view all your recent resources for easy access.
