Have you ever wanted to export an icon from the Microsoft Azure Portal but found yourself having to screenshot the icon at a low definition to include in your documentation or presentations?

Well - using the [Amazing Icon Downloader browser](https://github.com/mattl-msft/Amazing-Icon-Downloader "logo Amazing Icon Downloader"){:target="_blank"} plugin, you can export a single or all icons on a specific page in high definition as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file.

> Easily view all icons on a page, works with:
>
> * portal.azure.com
> * endpoint.microsoft.com
> * Search to filter down long lists of icons
> * Rename and download any single icon
> * Bulk download all icons as a .zip file
> * Works with either Chrome or Edge

The plugin is available on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazing-icon-downloader/kllljifcjfleikiipbkdcgllbllahaob "Amazing Icon Downloader"){:target="_blank"} or [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/amazing-icon-downloader/goanjjfecbakkdmbchgoooajnbiafong "Amazing Icon Downloader"){:target="_blank"} browser stores and is intuitive.

Once you install it, it is a matter of browsing the page you want and clicking the extension to export.

If you are after Visio stencils and other files, make sure you also check out [David Summers Azure Stencil collection](https://github.com/David-Summers/Azure-Design "David-Summers / Azure-Design"){:target="_blank"}.

You may run into an issue where a new feature or icon is released, and the stencil collection hasn't been updated yet - which is where the Amazing Icon Downloader can come in handy.
