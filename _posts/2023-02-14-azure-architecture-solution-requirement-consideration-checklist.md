Building a cloud solution on Azure can be an exciting yet daunting task.

The key to a successful implementation is carefully planning and considering solution requirements using the guidance of the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure"){:target="_blank"} and [Well Architecture frameworks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework"){:target="_blank"}.

But knowing what questions to ask and data to capture to give you the bigger picture - to not only consider the solution for the short term and long term, can be difficult. This is where the [Azure architecture solution requirements checklist](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/Azure_Checklists){:target="_blank"} comes in.

Leaning on the great frameworks already in place to assist with the Cloud Adoption and Azure Well Architecture frameworks, the solution requirements checklist is intended to act as a way of asking and capturing the requirements of your solutions. It can be a great reminder to discover some of those requirements _(whether functional or non-functional)_ that you may have forgotten about!

I am using the [Azure Review Checklist](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists "Azure/review-checklists"){:target="_blank"} - as a building block! I created a custom checklist intended to work alongside the review checklists - but aimed more at the discovery and requirements-gathering stage to assist with designing the proper outcomes for the business.

At the time of this article, there are 8 main categories, and various sub categories:

* AI
* Business
* Data
* Governance
* Infrastructure
* Microservices
* Observability
* Resiliency

Examples of some questions are:

> **Note: I do not create, edit or modify the Excel spreadsheet, created by for the Azure Reviews - I simply use it to run my custom checklist. Make sure to check out the** [**Azure Review Checklists**](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists "Azure Review Checklists")**!**

There are some settings that you might need to change in your system to run **macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet**s. When initially opening the file you may see the following error, which prevents Excel from loading:

> Excel cannot open the file 'review_checklist.xlsm' because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.

In other cases the file opens with the following message, which prevents you from being able to load the checklist items:

### Unblock file or add an exception to Windows Security

1. You might need to unblock the file from the file properties in the Windows File Explorer, so that you can use the macros required to import the checklist content from github.com:
2. Additionally, you might want to add the folder where you cloned this repo to the list of exceptions in Windows Security (in the Virus & Threat Protection section):
