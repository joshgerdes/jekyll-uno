Students learn in different ways through many possible avenues and experiences. Microsoft has assets to help students navigate through their journey.

This article aims to help to make access to student resources clearer.

#### Skilling Journey

There are 3 phases:

* Discover 
* Engage
* Grow

Each phase offers various ways of engage, learn and discover Microsoft Azure services and functionality.

Some of the resources for each phase can be found below:

_Use your university or school email to sign up and renew each year you're a student. Your school or university doesn't need to be enrolled in a program - your university and school email address is used to validate your student status._

##### Group Learner

If you are a group learner, alongside the same content as the indepedant learning path, check out the [Microsoft Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796){:target="_blank"} program to meet likeminded people, and don't forget to check out for your local [Azure meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/azuretechgroups/)!

##### Education Hub

Located in the Azure Portal, the Education Hub enables easy access to Azure offers and other academic benefits Microsoft provides.

Using the [Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/\~/overview "Education Hub"){:target="_blank"}, Students can:

* Download free software provided by their Academic Institution
* Sign up for academic-specific Azure offers

##### FAQS

A bit of a misleading heading! But there is no need to repeat FAQS that have already been answered by Microsoft or community members; the trick is finding where to go!

Most Student FAQs _(Frequently Asked Questions)_ can be answered on the following page:  

[Frequently asked questions about the Education Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Frequently asked questions about the Education Hub"){:target="_blank"}, but there may be other questions that don't fit in; if that's the case - make sure you check [Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?terms=students&category=QnA&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 '"students" in Q&A'){:target="_blank"} - as most likely, what you need has been answered by Microsoft or a community member.
