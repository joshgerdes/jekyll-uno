There may be circumstances, you need to open up multiple Microsoft Team instances, a reason for this - maybe to chat and join meetings across multiple accounts.

Microsoft are working on a version of [Microsoft Teams](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-public-preview/bd-p/MicrosoftTeamsPublicPreview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 "Microsoft Teams Public Preview") that supports multiple-accounts.
