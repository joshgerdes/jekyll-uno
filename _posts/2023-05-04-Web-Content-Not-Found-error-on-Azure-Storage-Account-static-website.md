Azure Storage accounts [can host static websites](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) by opening up a public endpoint to an Azure storage
container ($web), so anything inside of $web will be accessible publicly.

This can be enabled easily by toggling the Static website to Enabled.

Once enabled, the Azure storage account will add a NEW endpoint - \<storageaccname>.z\*.web.core.windows.net.

Once you have enabled the static website functionality, a new container named: $web will be created; this is the root of your static website â€“ and where your HTML or static website will go.

After you upload your website files to the $web folder.

Add the index document name (i.e., index.html) and click Save.

If done correctly, your website should now show your website.![Azure Storage account static websitev](/images/posts/AzureStorageAccount_Static_Site_WebContent_Website.png "Azure Storage account static website")

If done incorrectly, you may get: The requested content does not exist.
