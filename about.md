My name is Josh Duffney, I spent the first part of my career in technology avoiding programming. Since then, I've had a change of heart and started down the DevOps path. I quickly figured out coding is where I belong, I no longer consider my job a job. I'm a craftsman! I started my journey as a sysadmin. More specificly a Windows sysadmin. A few years ago I picked up PowerShell and have not looked back since. I have a long road a head of me as I seek to understand and apply all things DevOps, but I could not be more excited! Along this journey I'm dedicated to documenting my learnings. Whether that be in the form of blog posts, code repositories, presentations, or Pluralsight courses. My goal is to take as many of you with me as I can. Teach what I know and learn from you what I don't know. In the background, I have several obsessions. Biohacking, productivity hacking, health, fitness, and self improvement. Which are helping me unlock my full potential. You can learn more about me by reading [Doubling My Salary a PowerShell Story](http://duffney.io/doubling-my-salary-a-powershell-story) and [PowerShell Story Continued Becoming a Craftsman](http://duffney.io/PowerShell-Story-Continued-BecomingACraftsman)
