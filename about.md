A little bit about me...

I am a Senior Operations Engineer on the tech ops team at [Slack][slack] working with some of the most talented individuals I have ever met. I love my job.

I am terrible with words so please [open an issue on github][github_issue] or contact me if you find some of my bad grammar.

I dont have many hobbies but I actually enjoy using computers for some bizzare reason. Oddly, I do not play any video games.
