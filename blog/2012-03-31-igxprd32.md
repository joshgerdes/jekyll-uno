&#8220;igxprd32 display driver has stopped working&#8221;

This issue occurs due to a bug with the drivers, in order to repair this issue you have to rollback to a previous driver.

The Intel <a title="Driver_Download" href="http://www.bootwin.com/dell-drivers/dell-inspiron-1420-intel-gm965-express-chipset-family-x.html" target="_blank">6.14.10.4926 A06</a> drivers appear to be the most stable.
