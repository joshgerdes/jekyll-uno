_First off, you need a Raspberry Pi and an SD Card/Reader_

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Once obtained <strong>download</strong> <a title="Xbian Raspberry Pi" href="http://xbian.org/" target="_blank">Xbian</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once downloaded, make sure that the SD Card is blank or is safe to format and plugged in.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extract</strong> <strong>Xbian</strong> to a folder on your computer
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run</strong> the <strong><em>Win32 Extractor</em></strong> and make sure you <strong>select</strong> the <strong>SD-Card</strong> as the correct <strong>destination</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once selected press <strong>Run</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    The tool will then <strong>format</strong> <em>(erase)</em> everything on the <strong>SD-Card</strong> and <strong>overlay</strong> the <strong>Xbian</strong> software onto the card and make it bootable, it generally takes <em>1-2 minutes</em> to complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once completed make sure that nothing is writing to the SD-Card or has it open and take the card out.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Put</strong> the <strong>SD-Card</strong> into the <strong>Raspberry</strong> <strong>Pi</strong> <em>(the slot is underneath the Pi)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Plug the Pi into power and <strong>attach</strong> it up to <strong><em>a TV/Monitor</em></strong> using HDMI and let it <strong>boot</strong> up <strong>Xbian</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    As easy as that, you have now a fully functionally media centre.
  </li>
</ol>

_Note: Xbian automatically boots NTFS/FAT32 External HDDs, however make sure that the external HDD has its own power source the Pi doesn’t have enough juice to pump through to drives that only have one USB cable for both power and data._

_Note: To add Videos, click Add Videos, Add Files, Add Source, select the folder that contains the video files it is entirely normal for no videos to appear in this dialog.  _
