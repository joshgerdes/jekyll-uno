Getting the &#8220;Faulting application name: SimCitySocieties.exe, version: 1.0.4.243&#8221; and cannot play your game? Try the fix below.

_Usually caused by the Tradmark characters in a folder name &#8220;™&#8221; which Windows does not support._

  1. **Uninstall SimCity** Societies
  2. **Reinstall** the game and make sure the **install** **path** is **C:Program FilesElectronic ArtsSimCity Societies**

_Note: If the above does not work, then you need to edit the registry to change the games install path: &#8220;Install Dir&#8221; in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINESOFTWAREElectronic ArtsSimCity Societies&#8221;_
