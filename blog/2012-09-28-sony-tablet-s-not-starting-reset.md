_Having problems where your Sony S Tablet is getting power from the adapter but actually not turning on? I had this issue and this is how I got it running again._

  1. On the side panel of your Tablet you will see small letters, stating Reset.
  2. Get a **Pin** or Paper Clip and put it in the small **hole** next to the Reset word.
  3. **Hold** for **10 seconds**
  4. Your Tablet should now **restart** on its own.

_Note: Pressing the Reset button will not set the tablet back to Factory settings, but pressing the Reset button and turning your Tablet off will reset it back to Factory settings._
