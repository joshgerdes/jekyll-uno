    To send other people your Countdown Shopping list, do the following:

    First <em>(You have to have either a Bluetooth pair with the device or Internet access for email, going to run this guide through the email way but similar to other methods)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to the Countdown <strong>application</strong> on your phone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Select</strong> my <strong>lists</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Select</strong> the <strong>list</strong> you want to <strong>send</strong> for someone <em>(for example Master List)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you need to <strong>open</strong> up the Countdown <strong>menu</strong> <em>(so on your phone click the Menu button, for example on the Galaxy Ace it is the button with Lines going down on the left hand side of the phone)</em>
