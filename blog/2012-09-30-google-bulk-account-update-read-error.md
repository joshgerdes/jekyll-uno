Trying to upload a CSV file to get Google to create multiple users with the email address, first name, and last name & password fields and getting the &#8220;read error&#8221; trying to upload. This is how I fixed it:

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Locate the file you are uploading and <strong>remove</strong> the &#8220;.csv&#8221; file <strong>extension</strong>. Upload the file without the extension.
  </li>
</ol>

_To get rid of the CSV file extension, you might have to go to a folder, click on Tools, Options, Folder Options and uncheck Show File Extensions._
