Ever had a bunch of next and numbers in a column and needed to separate them with a space? Follow this guide.

  1. Find the column you want to add a space to and right click the column heading.
  2. Left click Format Cells
  3. Click Custom _(bottom)_
  4. Now work out how many letters/words you want before a space and type: # for each character, press Space where you want a space to be and then type the rest of the # _(for example for a NZ telephone number it would look like:  ### ####)_
  5. Click Ok to accept changes.

_Note: You can preview the changes you make in the preview dialog above the custom edit field._
