  1. Launch **App Store**
  2. Select **Featured** _(left most option – down bottom)_
  3. Scroll to the bottom and select your **account** _(the button is centered and long)_
  4. Here you can **change** your Account **country**.

If the above doesn&#8217;t work – you need to either create a new iTunes account temporarily or borrow someone’s.

  1. On the iPhone/iPod go to **Settings**
  2. Select **iTunes & App Store**
  3. **Log** **in** with an **English** apple **account**.
  4. **Open** App **Store**

The App Store will switch to English – you can now logout of the English account and the iPhone/iPod will retain its language setting.
