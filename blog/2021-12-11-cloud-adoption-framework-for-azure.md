To help with your Microsoft Cloud Adoption and Azure migration, you need a few things to be successful:

1. Define your **strategy**, what are your expected outcomes? Where do you start, what skills do you have or need?
2. **Plan**, this may include organisational alignment to get moving to the Cloud
3. **Ready**, this is where you look at your governance, Landing Zones /Blueprints
4. **Adopt**, this is where you actually migrate your workloads into the cloud, existing apps and new
